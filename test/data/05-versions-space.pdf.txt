17.      Pump Pressure/Pump Stroke Relationship
             (Also Called the Roughneck’s Formula)
Basic formula
New circulating  = present circulating X (new pump rate, spm  :  old pump rate, spm)
2
pressure, psi          pressure, psi
Example:  Determine the new circulating pressure, psi using the following data:
Present circulating pressure = 1800 psi
Old pump rate                      = 60 spm
New pump rate         = 30 spm
New circulating pressure, psi = 1800 psi x (30 spm  : 
 60 spm)
2
New circulating pressure, psi = 1800 psi x 0.25
New circulating pressure        = 450 psi
Determination of exact factor in above equation
The above formula is an approximation because the factor “
2
”  is a rounded-off number. To
determine the exact factor, obtain two pressure readings at different pump rates and use the
following formula:
Factor = log (pressure 1  :  pressure 2)
               log (pump rate 1  :   pump rate 2)
Example:    Pressure 1 = 2500 psi @ 315 gpm       Pressure 2 = 450 psi ~ 120 gpm
Factor = log (2500 psi ÷ 450 psi)
              log (315 gpm ÷ 120 gpm)
Factor =  log (5.5555556)
               log (2.625)
Factor = 1.7768
Example:  Same example as above but with correct factor:
New circulating pressure, psi = 1800 psi x (30 spm  ÷ 60 spm)
1.7768
New circulating pressure, psi = 1800 psi x (30 spm  ÷ 60 spm)
1.7768
New circulating pressure, psi = 1800 psi x 0.2918299
New circulating pressure        = 525 psi

2.                             Slug Calculations
Barrels of slug required for a desired length of dry pipe
Step 1   Hydrostatic pressure required to give desired drop inside drill pipe:
HP, psi = mud wt, ppg x 0.052 x ft of dry pipe
Step 2   Difference in pressure gradient between slug weight and mud weight:
psi/ft = (slug wt, ppg — mud wt, ppg) x 0.052
Step 3  Length of slug in drill pipe:
Slug length, ft = pressure, psi ÷ difference in pressure gradient, psi/ft

Formulas and Calculations
28
Step 4  Volume of slug, barrels:
Slug vol., bbl = slug length, ft  x  drill pipe capacity, bbl/ft
Example:Determine the barrels of slug required for the following:
Desired length of dry pipe (2 stands) = 184 ft                          Mud weight  = 12.2 ppg
Drill pipe capacity  4-1/2 in. — 16.6 lb/ft = 0.01422 bbl/ft       Slug weight  = 13.2 ppg
Step 1  Hydrostatic pressure required:
HP, psi = 12.2 ppg x 0.052 x 184 ft
HP       =  117 psi
Step 2   Difference in pressure gradient, psi/ft:
psi/ft = (13.2 ppg — 12.2 ppg) x 0.052
psi/ft = 0.052
Step 3   Length of slug in drill pipe, ft:
Slug length, ft = 117 psi   : 
 0.052
Slug length= 2250 ft
Step 4   Volume of slug, bbl:
Slug vol., bbl = 2250 ft x 0.01422 bbl/ft
Slug vol.      = 32.0 bbl
Weight of slug required for a desired length of dry pipe with a set volume
of slug
Step 1   Length of slug in drill pipe, ft:
Slug length, ft = slug vol., bbl ÷ drill pipe capacity, bbl/ft
Step 2   Hydrostatic pressure required to give desired drop inside drill pipe:
HP, psi = mud wt, ppg x 0.052 x ft of dry pipe
Step 3   Weight of slug, ppg:
Slug wt, ppg = HP, psi  ÷ 0.052 ÷ slug length, ft + mud wt, ppg
Example:  Determine the weight of slug required for the following:
Desired length of dry pipe (2 stands) = 184 ft                 Mud weight     = 12.2 ppg
Drill pipe capacity 4-1/2 in. — 16.6 lb/ft = 0.0 1422 bbl/ft    Volume of slug = 25 bbl

Formulas and Calculations
29
Step 1   Length of slug in drill pipe, ft:    Slug length, ft = 25 bbl ± 0.01422 bbl/ft
      Slug length      = 1758 ft
Step 2    Hydrostatic pressure required:   HP, Psi = 12.2 ppg x 0.052 x 184 ft
       HP, Psi = ll7psi
Step 3   Weight of slug, ppg:                  Slug wt, ppg = 117 psi ÷ 0.052 ÷ 1758 ft + 12.2 ppg
      Slug wt, ppg = 1.3 ppg + 12.2 ppg
      Slug wt         = 13.5 ppg
Volume, height, and pressure gained because of slug:
a)  Volume gained in mud pits after slug is pumped, due to U-tubing:
Vol., bbl = ft of dry pipe x drill pipe capacity, bbl/ft
b)  Height, ft, that the slug would occupy in annulus:
Height, ft = annulus vol., ft/bbl x slug vol., bbl
c)  Hydrostatic pressure gained in annulus because of slug:
HP, psi = height of slug in annulus, ft  X  difference in gradient, psi/ft  between
                                                                slug wt and mud wt
Example:  Feet of dry pipe (2 stands)  = 184 ft          Slug volume  = 32.4 bbl
     Slug weight                         = 13.2 ppg     Mud weight   = 12.2 ppg
                Drill pipe capacity4-1/2 in. 16.6 lb/ft  = 0.01422 bbl/ft
                Annulus volume (8-1/2 in. by 4-1/2 in.) = 19.8 ft/bbl
a)  Volume gained in mud pits after slug is pumped due to U-tubing:
Vol., bbl = 184 ft x 0.01422 bbl/ft
Vol.        = 2.62 bbl
b)  Height, ft, that the slug would occupy in the annulus:
Height, ft = 19.8 ft/bbl x 32.4 bbl
Height      = 641.5 ft
c)  Hydrostatic pressure gained in annulus because of slug:
HP, psi = 641.5 ft (13.2 — 12.2) x 0.052
HP, psi = 641.5 ft x 0.052
HP       = 33.4 psi

NOTE:  The following will be used as guidelines:     Volume per bottle  = 10 gal
              Pre-charge pressure = 1000 psi                  Maximum pressure = 3000 psi
              Minimum pressure remaining  after activation  = 1200 psi
              Pressure gradient of hydraulic fluid = 0.445 psi/ft

10.0 — 8.33 = 1.67 gal of hydraulic fluid per bottle.
NOTE:   This is dead hydraulic fluid. The pressure must not drop below this minimum value.

Step 3   Determine usable volume per bottle:
Useable vol./bottle  = Total hydraulic fluid/bottle — Dead hydraulic fluid/bottle
Useable vol./bottle  = 6.67 — 1.67
Useable vol./bottle  = 5.0 gallons

Subsea Applications
In subsea applications the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the hydraulic fluid must be
compensated for in the calculations:
Example:  Same guidelines as in surface applications:
                 Water depth  = 1000 ft     Hydrostatic pressure of hydraulic fluid = 445 psi
Step 1    Adjust all pressures for the hydrostatic pressure of the hydraulic fluid:
Pre-charge pressure = 1000 psi + 445 psi = 1445 psi
Minimum pressure   = 1200 psi + 445 psi = 1645 psi
Maximum pressure  = 3000 psi + 445 psi = 3445 psi
Step 2    Determine hydraulic fluid necessary to increase pressure from pre-charge to
                 minimum:
P

1645
V
2  
= 8.78 gal
10.0 — 8.78 = 1.22 gal of dead hydraulic fluid
Step 3    Determine hydraulic fluid necessary to increase pressure from pre-charge to
                 maximum:
1445 psi x 10 = 3445 psi x V
2
14450  = V

= 4.19 gal
10.0 — 4.19 = 5.81 gal of hydraulic fluid per bottle.
Step 4   Determine useable fluid volume per bottle:
Useable vol./bottle  = Total hydraulic fluid/bottle — Dead hydraulic fluid/bottle
Useable vol./bottle  = 5.81 — 1.22
Useable vol./bottle  = 4.59 gallons
Accumulator Pre-charge Pressure
The following is a method of measuring the average accumulator pre-charge pressure by
operating the unit with the charge pumps switched off:

Formulas and Calculations
32
P,psi =  vol. removed, bbl ÷ total acc. vol., bbl  x  ((Pf x Ps) ÷ (Ps — Pf))
where  P   = average pre-charge pressure, psi     Pf = final accumulator pressure, psi
            Ps = starting accumulator pressure, psi
Example:  Determine the average accumulator pre-charge pressure using the following data:
Starting accumulator pressure (Ps) = 3000 psi      Final accumulator pressure (Pf)= 2200 psi
Volume of fluid removed                = 20 gal          Total accumulator volume= 180 gal
P, psi = 20 ÷ 180  x  ((2200 x 3000) ÷ (3000 — 2200))
P, psi = 0.1111 x  (6,600,000 ÷ 800)
P, psi = 0.1111 x  8250
P        = 9l7psi
4.      Bulk Density of Cuttings (Using Mud Balance)
Procedure:
1. Cuttings must be washed free of mud. In an oil mud, diesel oil can be used instead of water.
2. Set mud balance at 8.33 ppg.
3. Fill the mud balance with cuttings until a balance is obtained with the lid in place.
4. Remove lid, fill cup with water (cuttings included), replace lid, and dry outside of mud
    balance.
5. Move counterweight to obtain new balance.
The specific gravity of the cuttings is calculated as follows:
SG =        1           .
         2 (O.l2 x Rw)
where     SG = specific gravity of’ cuttings — bulk density
              Rw = resulting weight with cuttings plus water, ppg

Feet of drill pipe that can be used with a specific bottom hole assembly (BHA).
1. Length of bottom hole assembly necessary for a desired weight on bit:
Length, ft = WOB x f
                    Wdc x BF
where     WOB = desired weight to be used while drilling
                      f = safety factor to place neutral point in drill collars
                Wdc = drill collar weight, lb/ft

Example:  Drill pipe (5.0 in.) = 21.87 lb/ft - Grade G   Tensile strength = 554,000 lb
                 BHA weight in air = 50,000 lb                     BHA length       = 500 ft
     Desired overpull    = 100,000 lb                    Mud weight      = 13.5 ppg
     Safety factor          = 10%
a)  Buoyancy factor:
BF =  65.5 —  13.5
                65.5
BF = 0.7939
b)  Maximum length of drill pipe that can be run into the hole:
Length
max
 = [(554,000 x 0.90) — 100,000 — 50,000] x 0.7939
                                                   21.87

                 Wp = buoyed weight of drill pipe, lb/ft
                    D = depth of hole, ft
               Lp    = length of one stand of drill pipe, (aye), ft
               Wb   = weight of travelling block assembly, lb

                           length of  drill pipe, lb
               2000 = number of pounds in one ton
               5280 = number of feet in one mile
Example:  Round trip ton-miles
Mud weight       = 9.6 ppg       Average length of one stand  = 60 ft (double)
Drill pipe weight    = 13.3 lb/ft     Measured depth                     = 4000 ft
Drill collar length   = 300 ft          Travelling block assembly     = 15,000 lb
Drill collar weight  = 83 lb/ft
Solution:a) Buoyancy factor:
BF = 65.5 - 9.6 ppg.  : 
 65.5
BF = 0.8534
b) Buoyed weight of drill pipe in mud, lb/ft (Wp):
Wp = 13.3 lb/ft x 0.8534
Wp = 11.35 lb/ft
c) Buoyed weight of drill collars in mud minus the buoyed weight of the same length of drill
    pipe, lb (Wc):
Wc = (300 x 83 x 0.8534) — (300 x 13.3 x 0.8534)
Wc = 21,250 — 3,405
Wc = 17,845 lb
Round trip ton-miles =  11.35 x 4000 x (60 + 4000) + (2 x 4000) x (2 x 15000 + 17845)
                                                                5280 x 2000

Drilling or “connection” ton-miles
The ton-miles of work performed in drilling operations is expressed in terms of work
performed in making round trips. These are the actual ton-miles of work in drilling down the
length of a section of drill pipe (usually approximately 30 ft) plus picking up, connecting, and
starting to drill with the next section.
To determine connection or drilling ton-miles, take 3 times (ton-miles for current round trip
minus ton-miles for previous round trip):
Td = 3(T
2 
— T
1
)
where  Td = drilling or “connection” ton-miles
            T
2  
= ton-miles for one round trip — depth where drilling stopped before coming out
                    of hole.
            T
1 
= ton-miles for one round trip — depth where drilling started.
Example:   Ton-miles for trip @ 4600 ft = 64.6   Ton-miles for trip @ 4000 ft = 53.7
Td = 3 x (64.6 — 53.7)
Td = 3 x 10.9
Td = 32.7 ton-miles
Ton-miles during coring operations
The ton-miles of work performed in coring operations, as for drilling operations, is expressed
in terms of work performed in making round trips.
To determine ton-miles while coring, take 2 times ton-miles for one round trip at the depth
where coring stopped minus ton-miles for one round trip at the depth where coring began:
Tc = 2 (T
4 
— T
3
)
where Tc =  ton-miles while coring
           T
4 
=  ton-miles for one round trip — depth where coring stopped before coming out of
                    hole
           T
3 
=  ton-miles for one round trip — depth where coring started after going in hole
Ton-miles setting casing
The  calculations  of  the  ton-miles  for  the  operation  of  setting  casing  should  be  determined  as
for  drill  pipe,  but  with  the  buoyed  weight  of  the  casing  being  used,  and  with  the  result  being
multiplied  by  one-half,  because  setting  casing  is  a  one-way  (1/2  round  trip)  operation.  Ton-
miles for setting casing can be determined from the following formula:
Tc =  Wp x D x (Lcs + D) + D x Wb  x 0.5
                         5280 x 2000
where  Tc  = ton-miles setting casing                 Wp = buoyed weight of casing, lb/ft
           Lcs = length of one joint of casing, ft      Wb = weight of travelling block assembly, lb

Formulas and Calculations
37
Ton-miles while making short trip
The ton-miles of work performed in short trip operations, as for drilling and coring operations,
is  also  expressed  in  terms  of  round  trips.  Analysis  shows  that  the  ton-miles  of  work  done  in
making  a  short  trip  is  equal  to  the  difference  in  round  trip  ton-miles  for  the  two  depths  in
question.
Tst = T
6 
— T
5
where   Tst =  ton-miles for short trip
              T
6 
=  ton-miles for one round trip at the deeper depth, the depth of the bit before
                       starting the short trip.
              T
5 
=  ton-miles for one round trip at the shallower depth, the depth that the bit is
                       pulled up to.

Determine the difference in pressure gradient, psi/ft, between the cement
and the mud
psi/ft = (15.8 — 8.8) x 0.052
psi/ft = 0.364
Determine the differential pressure between the cement and the mud
psi = 0.364 psi/ft x 164 ft
psi = 60
Determine the area, sq in., below the shoe
area, sq in. = 13.3752 x 0.7854
area,          = 140.5 sq in.
Determine the upward force. This is the total force acting at the bottom of
the shoe
Force, lb = 140.5 sq in. x 60 psi
Force      = 8430 lb
Determine the downward force. This is the weight of the casing
Weight, lb = 54.5 lb/ft x 164 ft x 0.8656
Weight      = 7737 lb
Determine the difference in force, lb
Differential force, lb = downward force, lb — upward force, lb
Differential force, lb = 7737 lb — 8430 lb
Differential force      = — 693 lb
Therefore:  Unless the casing is tied down or stuck, it could possibly hydraulic out (move
                  upward).
Pressure required to balance the forces so that the casing will not hydraulic
out (move upward)
psi = 693 lb   : 
 140.5 sq in.
psi = 4.9
Mud weight increase to balance pressure
Mud wt, ppg = 4.9 psi    : 
  0.052 ÷ 164 ft
Mud wt        = 0.57 ppg

Formulas and Calculations

New mud weight, ppg
New mud wt, ppg = 8.8 ppg + 0.6 ppg
New mud wt         = 9.4 ppg
Check the forces with the new mud weight
a)  psi/ft = (15.8 — 9.4) x 0.052
     psi/ft = 0.3328
b)  psi = 0.3328 psi/ft x 164 ft
     psi = 54.58
c)  Upward force, lb = 54.58 psi x 140.5 sq in.
     Upward force      = 7668 lb
d)  Differential force, lb = downward force — upward force
     Differential force, lb = 7737 lb — 7668 lb
     Differential force      = + 69 lb
14.                       Depth of a Washout
Method 1
Pump soft line or other plugging material down the drill pipe and notice how many strokes are
required before the pump pressure increases.
Depth of washout, ft =  strokes required  x pump output, bbl/stk ÷ drill pipe capacity, bbl/ft
Example:  Drill pipe       = 3-1/2 in. 13.3 lb/ft
                 Capacity        = 0.00742 bbl/ft
                 Pump output = 0.112 bbl/stk (5-1/2 in. by 14 in. duplex @ 90% efficiency)
NOTE:A pressure increase was noticed after 360 strokes.
Depth of washout, ft = 360 stk x 0.112 bbl/stk ÷  0.00742 bbl/ft
Depth of washout      = 5434 ft
Method 2
Pump some material that will go through the washout, up the annulus and over the shale
shaker. This material must be of the type that can be easily observed as it comes across the
shaker. Examples: carbide, corn starch, glass beads, bright coloured paint, etc.
Depth of      =  strokes  x  pump output, ÷ (drill pipe capacity, bbl/ft + annular capacity, bbl/ft)
washout, ft      required       bbl/stk

Formulas and Calculations
55
Example:  Drill pipe              = 3-1/2 in. 13.3 lb/ft capacity = 0.00742 bbl/ft
                 Pump output        = 0.112 bbl/stk (5-1/2 in. x 14 in. duplex @ 90% efficiency)
                 Annulus hole size = 8-1/2 in.
                 Annulus capacity  = 0.0583 bbl/ft (8-1/2 in. x 3-1/2 in.)
NOTE:  The material pumped down the drill pipe was noticed coming over the shaker
               after 2680 strokes.
Drill pipe capacity plus annular capacity:
0.00742 bbl/ft + 0.0583 bbl/ft = 0.0657 bbl/ft
Depth of washout, ft = 2680 stk x 0.112 bbl/stk ÷  0.0657 bbl/ft
Depth of washout      = 4569 ft

Equivalent mud weight at TD
EMW, ppg = mud wt, ppg — (BHP decrease, psi  ÷ 0.052  ÷ TVD, ft)
Example:   Mud weight        = 12.5 ppg     Water added        = 150 bbl required to fill annulus
                  Weight of water = 8.33 ppg     Annular capacity = 0.1279 bbl/ft (12-1/4 x 5.0 in.)
                  TVD                  = 10,000 ft
Number of feet of water in annulus
Feet = 150 bbl  ÷  0.1279 bbl/ft
Feet = 1173
Bottomhole pressure decrease
BHP decrease, psi = (12.5 ppg — 8.33 ppg) x 0.052 x 1173 ft
BHP decrease      = 254 psi
Equivalent mud weight at TD
EMW, ppg = 12.5 — (254 psi  ÷  0.052 — 10,000 ft)
EMW       = 12.0 ppg

Determine free point constant (FPC)
The free point constant can be determined for any type of steel drill pipe if the outside
diameter, in., and inside diameter, in., are known:
FPC = As x 2500
where:   As = pipe wall cross sectional area, sq in.
Example 1:From the drill pipe stretch table:  4-1/2 in. drill pipe 16.6 lb/ft — ID = 3.826 in.
FPC = (452 — 3.8262 x 0.7854) x 2500
FPC = 4.407 x 2500
FPC = 11,017.5
Example 2:Determine the free point constant and the depth the pipe is stuck using the
                        following data:
2-3/8 in. tubing — 6.5 lb/ft — ID = 2.441 in.     25 in. of stretch with 20,000 lb of pull force
a)  Determine free point constant (FPC):
FPC = (2.875
2

2
 x 0.7854) x 2500
FPC = 1.820 x 2500
FPC = 4530
b)  Determine the depth of stuck pipe:
Feet of free pipe =  25 in. x 4530
                                   20 Feet
Feet of free pipe = 5663 ft
Method 2
Free pipe, ft = 735,294 x  e  x  Wdp
                        differential pull, lb
where   e       = pipe stretch, in.
            Wdp = drill pipe weight, lb/ft (plain end)
Plain end weight, lb/ft, is the weight of drill pipe excluding tool joints:
Weight, lb/ft = 2.67 x pipe OD, in.

                 Differential stretch of pipe = 24 in.
                 Differential pull to obtain stretch = 30,000 lb

Determine the height, ft of unweighted spotting fluid that will balance
formation pressure in the annulus:
a)  Determine the difference in pressure gradient, psi/ft, between the mud weight and the
     spotting fluid:
psi/ft = (mud wt, ppg — spotting fluid wt, ppg) x 0.052
b)   Determine the height, ft, of unweighted spotting fluid that will balance formation pressure
      in the annulus:
Height ft =  amount of overbalance, psi  ÷ difference in pressure gradient, psi/ft
Example.  Use the following data to determine the height, ft, of spotting fluid that will balance
                formation pressure in the annulus:
Data: Mud weight   = 11.2 ppg         Weight of spotting fluid = 7.0 ppg
Amount of overbalance = 225.0 psi
a)  Difference in pressure gradient, psi/ft:
psi/ft = (11.2 ppg — 7.0 ppg) x 0.052
psi/ft = 0.2184
a)  Determine the height, ft. of unweighted spotting fluid that will balance formation pressure
     in the annulus:
Height, ft = 225 psi ÷ 0.2184 psi/ft
Height      = 1030 ft
Therefore:Less than 1030 ft of spotting fluid should be used to maintain a safety factor to
                       prevent a kick or blow-out.

Annular capacity           = 0.0459 bbl/ft
Step 2  Determine total volume of pill required in annulus:
a)  Volume opposite drill collars:
Vol, bbl = 0.02914 bbl/ft x 600 ft x 1.20
Vol       = 21.0 bbl
b)  Volume opposite drill pipe:
Vol, bbl = 0.0459 bbl/ft x 200 ft x 1.20
Vol        = 11.0 bbl
c)  Total volume bbl, required in annulus:
Vol, bbl = 21.0 bbl + 11.0 bbl
Vol        = 32.0 bbl
Step 3  Total bbl of spotting fluid (pill) required:
Barrels = 32.0 bbl (annulus) + 24.0 bbl (drill pipe)
Barrels = 56.0 bbl
Step 4  Determine drill string capacity:
a)  Drill collar capacity, bbl:

where   Pgs = pressure required to break gel strength, psi
             y   = 10 mm gel strength of drilling fluid, lb/100 sq ft
             d   = inside diameter of drill pipe, in.
            L    = length of drill string, ft
Example:      y = 10 lb/100 sq ft    d = 4.276 in.   L= 12,000 ft
Pgs = (10 ÷ 300 — 4.276) 12,000 ft
Pgs = 0.007795 x 12,000 ft
Pgs = 93.5 psi
Therefore, approximately 94 psi would be required to break circulation.

Formulas and Calculations

Pressure required to overcome the mud’s gel strength in the annulus
Pgs = y ÷ [300 (Dh, in. — Dp, in.)] x L
where    Pgs = pressure required to break gel strength, psi
             L    = length of drill string, ft
 y    = 10 mm. gel strength of drilling fluid, lb/100 sq ft
 Dh  = hole diameter, in.
   Dp  = pipe diameter, in.
Example:  L = 12,000 ft                y    = 10 lb/100 sq ft
Dh = 12-1/4 in.             Dp = 5.0 in.
Pgs = 10 ÷ [300 x (12.25 — 5.0)] x 12,000 ft
Pgs = 10 ÷ 2175 x 12,000 ft
Pgs = 55.2 psi
Therefore, approximately 55 psi would be required to break circulation.

Oil/water ratio from retort data
Obtain the percent-by-volume oil and percent-by-volume water from retort analysis or mud
still analysis. From the data obtained, the oil/water ratio is calculated as follows:

Formulas and Calculations

a) % oil in liquid phase =          % by vol oil                      x 100
                                        % by vol oil + % by vol water
b) % water in liquid phase =          % by vol water                 x  100
                                             % by vol oil + % by vol water
c)  Result: The oil/water ratio is reported as the percent oil and the percent water.
Example:   Retort analysis:  % by volume oil      = 51
                                            % by volume water = 17
                                            % by volume solids = 32
Solution:
a) % oil in liquid phase       =   51      x  100
                                              51 x 17
     % oil in liquid phase      = 75
b)  % water in liquid phase =   17       x 100
                                              51 + 17
     % water in liquid phase = 25
c) Result:  Therefore, the oil/water ratio is reported as 75/25: 75% oil and 25% water.
Changing oil/water ratio
NOTE:  If the oil/water ratio is to be increased, add oil; if it is to be decreased, add water.
Retort analysis: % by volume oil       = 51
                         % by volume water  = 17
                         % by volume solids  = 32
The oil/water ratio is 75/25.
Example 1:  Increase the oil/water ratio to 80/20:
In 100 bbl of this mud, there are 68 bbl of liquid (oil plus water). To increase the oil/water
ratio, add oil. The total liquid volume will be increased by the volume of the oil added, but the
water volume will not change. The 17 bbl of water now in the mud represents 25% of the
liquid volume, but it will represent only 20% of the new liquid volume.
Therefore:  let x = final liquid volume
then, 0.20x = 17
               x = 17  : 
 0.20
               x = 85 bbl
The new liquid volume = 85 bbl

Formulas and Calculations
71
Barrels of oil to be added:
Oil, bbl = new liquid vol — original liquid vol
Oil, bbl = 85 — 68
Oil = 17 bbl oil per 100 bbl of mud
Check the calculations. If the calculated amount of liquid is added, what will be the resulting
oil/water ratio?
% oil in liquid phase = original vol oil + new vol oil           x 100
                                    original liquid oil + new oil added
% oil in liquid phase = 51+17    x  100
                                    68 + 17
% oil in liquid phase = 80
% water would then be: 100 — 80 = 20
Therefore:The new oil/water ratio would be 80/20.
Example 2:   Change the oil/water ratio to 70/30:
As in Example I, there are 68 bbl of liquid in 100 bbl of this mud. In this case, however, water
will be added and the volume of oil will remain constant. The 51 bbl of oil represents 75% of
the original liquid volume and 70% of the final volume:
Therefore:let x = final liquid volume
then, 0.70x = 51
               x = 51  : 
 0.70
               x = 73 bbl
Barrels of water to be added:
Water, bbl = new liquid vol — original liquid vol
Water, bbl = 73 — 68
Water        = 5 bbl of water per 100 bbl of mud
Check the calculations. If the calculated amount of water is added, what will be the resulting
oil/water ratio?
% water in liquid phase =  17 + 5  x  100
                                          68 + 5
% water in liquid           =  30
% oil in liquid phase      =  100 — 30 = 70
Therefore, the new oil/water ratio would be 70/30.

                             1.6
Step 7  Percent by volume barite
Barite, % by vol = % by vol solids — % by vol LGS
Step 8  Pounds per barrel barite
Barite, lb/bbl = % by vol barite x 14.71
Step 9  Bentonite determination
If cation exchange capacity (CEC)/methytene blue test (MBT) of shale and mud are KNOWN:

Bentonite, lb/bbl  = 1  : 
  (1— (S  :  65) x (M— 9 x (S  :  65)) x % by vol LGS
Where     S = CEC of shale                 M = CEC of mud

b)  Bentonite, % by volume:
Bent, % by vol = bentonite, lb/bbl ÷ 9.1
If the cation exchange capacity (CEC)/methylene blue (MBT) of SHALE is UNKNOWN:

where M = CEC of mud
b)  Bentonite, lb/bbl = bentonite, % by vol x 9.1
Step 10  Drilled solids, % by volume
Drilled solids, % by vol = LGS, % by vol — bentonite, % by vol
Step 11  Drilled solids, lb/bbl

Kill weight mud (KWM)                  480 psi ÷ 0.052 ÷ 10,000 ft + 9.6 ppg    = 10.5 ppg

Kill Sheet With a Tapered String
psi @ _____ strokes  = ICP — [ (DPL ÷ DSL) x (ICP — FCP)]
Note:Whenever a kick is taken with a tapered drill string in the hole, interim pressures
            should be calculated for a) the length of large drill pipe (DPL) and b) the length of
            large drill pipe plus the length of small drill pipe.
Example: Drill pipe 1: 5.0 in.    19.5 lb/ft                Capacity = 0.01776 bbl/ft Length = 7000 ft
                Drill pipe 2: 3-1/2 in. 13.3 lb/ft                Capacity = 0.0074 bbl/ft  Length = 6000 ft
                Drill collars: 4 1/2 in. OD x 1-1/2 in. ID  Capacity = 0.0022 bbl/ft  Length = 2000 ft
Step 1   Determine strokes:
7000 ft x 0.01776 bbl/ft ÷ 0.117 bbl/stk = 1063
6000 ft x 0.00742 bbl/ft ÷ 0.117 bbl/stk = 381
2000 ft x 0.0022   bbl/ft ÷ 0.117 bbl/stk = 38
Total strokes                                         = 1482
Data from kill sheet
Initial drill pipe circulating pressure (ICP) = 1780 psi
Final drill pipe circulating pressure (FCP) = 1067 psi
Step 2  Determine interim pressure for the 5.0 in. drill pipe at 1063 strokes:
psi @ 1063 strokes = 1780 — [(7000 ÷ 15,000) x (1780 — 1067)]
                                = 1780 —  (0.4666 x 713)
                                = 1780 —  333
                                = 1447 psi

Formulas and Calculations
89
Step 3  Determine interim pressure for 5.0 in. plus 3-1/2 in. drill pipe
               (1063 + 381) =  1444 strokes:
psi @ 1444 strokes = 1780 — [(11,300 ÷ 15,000) x (1780 — 1067)]
                               = 1780 — (0.86666 x 713)
                               = 1780 — 618
                               = 1162 psi
Step 4  Plot data on graph paper
Figure 4-1. Data from kill sheet.
Note.After pumping 1062 strokes, if a straight line would have been plotted, the well would
have been underbalanced by 178 psi.
Kill Sheet for a Highly Deviated Well
Whenever a kick is taken in a highly deviated well, the circulating pressure can be
excessive when the kill weight mud gets to the kick-off point (KOP). If the pressure is
excessive, the pressure schedule should be divided into two sections: 1) from surface to KOP,
and 2) from KOP to TD. The following calculations are used:
Determine strokes from surface to KOP:
Strokes = drill pipe capacity, bbl!ft  x  measured depth to KOP, ft  x   pump output,  bbl/stk

Formulas and Calculations
90
Determine strokes from KOP to TD:
Strokes = drill string capacity, bbl/ftx  measured depth to TD, ft  x  pump output, bbl/stk
Kill weight mud:                         KWM = SIDPP ÷ 0.052 ÷ TVD + OMW
Initial circulating pressure:          ICP = SIDPP + KRP
Final circulating pressure:           FCP KWM x KRP ÷ 0MW
Hydrostatic pressure increase from surface to KOP:
psi = (KWM - OMW) x 0.052 x TVD @ KOP
Friction pressure increase to KOP:
FP = (FCP - KRP) x MD @ KOP ÷ MD @ TD
Circulating pressure when KWM gets to KOP:
CP ~ KOP = ICP — HP increase to KOP + friction pressure
increase, psi
Note:At this point, compare this circulating pressure to the value obtained when using a
regular kill sheet.
Example:    Original mud weight (OMW)           = 9.6 ppg
                   Measured depth (MD)                     = 15,000 ft
                   Measured depth @ KOP                  = 5000 ft
                   True vertical depth @ KOP             = 5000 ft
       Kill rate pressure (KRP) @ 30 spm  = 600 psi
        Pump output                                    = 0.136 bbl/stk
                   Drill pipe capacity                            = 0.01776 bbl/ft
       Shut-in drill pipe pressure (SIDPP)  = 800 psi
                   True vertical depth (TVD)               = 10,000 ft
Solution:
Strokes from surface to KOP:
Strokes = 0.01776 bbl/ft x 5000 ft ÷ 0.136 bbl/stk
Strokes = 653
Strokes from KOP to TD:
Strokes = 0.01776 bbl/ft x 10,000 ft + 0.136 bbl/stk
Strokes = 1306

Formulas and Calculations
91
Total strokes from surface to bit:
Surface to bit strokes = 653 + 1306
Surface to bit strokes = 1959
Kill weight mud (KWM):
KWM = 800 psi 0.052 + 10,000 ft + 9.6 ppg
KWM = 11.1 ppg
Initial circulating pressure (ICP):
ICP = 800 psi + 600 psi
ICP = 1400 psi
Final circulating pressure (FCP):
FCP = 11.1 ppg x 600 psi ± 9.6 ppg
FCP = 694 psi
Hydrostatic pressure increase from surface to KOP:
HPi = (11.1 — 9.6) x 0.052 x 5000
HPi = 390 psi
Friction pressure increase to TD:
FP = (694 — 600) x 5000 ÷ 15,000
FP = 31 psi
Circulating pressure when KWM gets to KOP:
CP = 1400 — 390 + 31
CP = 1041 psi
Compare this circulating pressure to the value obtained when using a regular kill sheet:
psi/stk = 1400 — 694 + 1959
psi/stk = 0.36
0.36psi/stk x 653 strokes = 235 psi
1400 — 235 = 1165 psi
Using a regular kill sheet, the circulating drill pipe pressure would be 1165 psi. The
adjusted pressure chart would have 1041 psi on the drill pipe gauge. This represents 124 psi
difference in pressure, which would also be observed on the annulus (casing) side. It is
recommended that if the difference in pressure at the KOP is 100 psi or greater, then the
adjusted pressure chart should be used to minimise the chances of losing circulation.

Formulas and Calculations
92
The chart below graphically illustrates the difference:

Maximum Anticipated Surface Pressure
Two methods are commonly used to determine maximum anticipated surface pressure:
Method 1:  Use when assuming the maximum formation pressure is from
                   TD:
Step 1  Determine maximum formation pressure (FPmax):
FP max = (maximum mud wt to be used, ppg + safety factor, ppg) x 0.052 x (total depth, ft)
Step 2  Assuming 100% of the mud is blown out of the hole, determine the hydrostatic
              pressure in the wellbore:
Note:70% to 80% of mud being blown out is sometimes used instead of l00%.
HPgas = gas gradient, psi/ft x total depth, ft
Step 3  Determine maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP):
MASP = FPmax — HPgas

Formulas and Calculations
93
Example:       Proposed total depth                                              = 12,000 ft
                      Maximum mud weight to be used in drilling well    = 12.0 ppg
                      Safety factor                                                          = 4.0 ppg
                      Gas gradient                                                          =  0.12 psi/ft
Assume that 100% of mud is blown out of well.
Step 1   Determine fracture pressure, psi:
FPmax = (12.0 + 4.0) x 0.052 x 12,000 ft
FPmax = 9984 psi
Step 2
HPgas = 0.12 x 12,000 ft
HPgas = 1440 psi
Step 3
MASP = 9984 — 1440
MASP = 8544 psi
Method 2: Use when assuming the maximum pressure in the wellbore is
                  attained when the formation at the shoe fractures:
Step 1
Fracture, psi  =  (estimated fracture + safety factor, ppg) x 0.052 x (casing shoe TVD, ft)
pressure             (gradient, ppg                                       )
Note:A safety factor is added to ensure the formation fractures before BOP pressure rating
is exceeded.
Step 2   Determine the hydrostatic pressure of gas in the wellbore (HPgas):
HPgas = gas gradient, psi/ft x casing shoe TVD, ft
Step 3   Determine the maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP), psi:
Example:    Proposed casing setting depth    = 4000 ft
                  Estimated fracture gradient         = 14.2 ppg
                  Safety factor                               = 1.0 ppg
                  Gas gradient                               =  0.12 psi/ft
Assume 100°/ of mud is blown out of the hole.
Step 1    Fracture pressure, psi  = (14.2 + 1.0) x 0.052 x 4000 ft
                 Fracture pressure, psi  = 3162 psi
Step 2    HPgas = 0.12 x 4000 ft
                 HPgas = 480 psi

Formulas and Calculations
94
Step 3    MASP = 3162 — 480
                 MASP = 2682 psi
Sizing Diverter Lines
Determine diverter line inside diameter, in., equal to the area between the inside diameter of
the casing and the outside diameter of drill pipe in use:
Diverter line ID, in. = ~Ib~bp2
Example:   Casing— 13-3/8 in. — J-55 — 61 IbIft ID = 12.515 in.
                  Drill pipe — 19.5 lb/ft OD                          = 5.0 in.
Determine the diverter line inside diameter that will equal the area between the casing and drill
pipe:
Diverter line ID, in. = sq. root (12.515
2
 — 5.0
2
)
Diverter line ID = 11.47 in.
Formation Pressure Tests
Two methods of testing:          •Equivalent mud weight test
 •Leak-off test
Precautions to be undertaken before testing:
1.        Circulate and condition the mud to ensure the mud weight is consistent throughout the
           system.
2.        Change the pressure gauge (if possible) to a smaller increment gauge so a more
           accurate measure can be determined.
3.        Shut-in the well.
4.        Begin pumping at a very slow rate — 1/4 to 1/2 bbl/min.
5.        Monitor pressure, time, and barrels pumped.
6.        Some operators may have different procedures in running this test, others may
           include:
a.   Increasing the pressure by 100 psi increments, waiting for a few minutes, then
increasing by another 100 psi, and so on, until either the equivalent mud weight is
achieved or until Leak-off is achieved.
b.   Some operators prefer not pumping against a closed system. They prefer to
circulate through the choke and increase back pressure by slowly closing the choke. In
this method, the annular pressure loss should be calculated and added to the test
pressure results.

Formulas and Calculations
95
Testing to an equivalent mud weight:
1)This test is used primarily on development wells where the maximum mud weight that
            will be used to drill the next interval is known.
2)Determine the equivalent test mud weight, ppg, Two methods are normally used.
Method 1:Add a value to the maximum mud weight that is needed to drill the interval.
Example:Maximum mud weight necessary to drill the next interval = 11.5 ppg plus
                       safety factor = 1.0 ppg
Equivalent test mud weight, ppg = (maximum mud weight,  ppg) + (safety factor, ppg)
Equivalent test mud weight         = 11.5 ppg + 1.0 ppg
Equivalent test mud weight         = 12.5 ppg
Method 2:Subtract a value from the estimated fracture gradient for the depth of the
                       casing shoe.
Equivalent test mud weight =  (estimated fracture gradient, ppg ) — (safety factor)
Example:Estimated formation fracture gradient = 14.2 ppg. Safety factor = 1.0 ppg
Equivalent test mud weight  = 14.2 ppg — 1.0 ppg
Determine surface pressure to be used:
Surface pressure, psi= (equiv. Test    —  mud wt,    ) x 0.052 x (casing seat, TVD ft)
                                      (mud wt, ppg       in use, ppg)
 Example:   Mud weight                        = 9.2 ppg
       Casing shoe TVD               = 4000 ft
       Equivalent test mud weight = 13.2 ppg
Solution:Surface pressure = (13.2 — 9.2) x 0.052 x 4000 ft
Surface pressure = 832 psi
Testing to leak-off test:
1)  This test is used primarily on wildcat or exploratory wells or where the actual fracture is
     not known.
2)  Determine the estimated fracture gradient from a “Fracture Gradient Chart.”
3)  Determine the estimated leak-off pressure.
Estimated leak-off pressure = (estimated fracture — mud wt      ) x 0.052 x (casing shoe)
                                              (gradient                      in use, ppg)                 ( TVD, ft   )

Formulas and Calculations
96
Example:  Mud weight               = 9.6 ppg       Casing shoe TVD  = 4000 ft
                Estimated fracture gradient   = 14.4 ppg
Solution:Estimated leak-off pressure = (14.4 — 9.6) x 0.052 x 4000 ft
Estimated leak-off pressure = 4.8 x 0.052 x 4000
Estimated leak-off pressure = 998 psi
Maximum Allowable Mud Weight From Leak-off Test Data
Max allowable      = (leak off pressure, psi) ÷ 0.052 ÷ (casing shoe) + (mud wt in use, ppg)
mud weight, ppg                                                          ( TVD, ft   )
Example:   Determine the maximum allowable mud weight, ppg, using the following data:
Leak-off pressure   =1040 psi
Casing shoe TVD   =4000 ft
Mud weight in use  =10.0 ppg
Max allowable mud weight, ppg = 1040 + 0.052 -~- 4000 + 10.0
Max allowable mud weight, ppg = 15.0 ppg
Maximum Allowable Shut-in Casing Pressure (MASLCP)
also called maximum allowable shut-in annular pressure (MASP):
MASICP = (maximum allowable — mud wt in use, ppg) x 0.052 x (casing shoe TVD, ft)
                   (mud wt, ppg                                              )
Example:  Determine the maximum allowable shut-in casing pressure using the following data:
Maximum allowable mud weight = 15.0 ppg
Mud weight in use                = 12.2 ppg
Casing shoe TVD                = 4000 ft
MASICP = (15.0 — 12.2) x 0.052 x 4000 ft
MASICP = 582 psi
Kick Tolerance Factor (KTF)
KTF =  Casing shoe TVD, ft)  x  (maximum allowable mud wt, ppg — mud wt in use, ppg)
                  well depth
Example:   Determine the kick tolerance factor (KTF) using the following data:
Mud weight in use= 10.0 ppg
Casing shoe TVD= 4000 ft
Well depth TVD= 10,000 ft
Maximum allowable mud weight (from leak-off test data) = 14.2 ppg

Formulas and Calculations
97
KTF = (4000 ft ÷ 10,000 ft) x (14.2 ppg — 10.0 ppg)
KTF = 1.68 ppg
Maximum Surface Pressure From Kick Tolerance Data
Maximum surface pressure = kick tolerance factor, ppg x 0.052 x TYD, ft
Example:   Determine the maximum surface pressure, psi, using the following data:
Maximum surface pressure = 1.68 ppg x 0.052 x 10,000 ft
Maximum surface pressure = 874 psi
Maximum Formation Pressure (FP) That Can be Controlled When
Shutting-in a Well
Maximum FP, psi = (kick tolerance factor, ppg + mud wt in use, ppg) x 0.052 x TYD, ft
Example:   Determine the maximum formation pressure (FP) that can be controlled when
                  shutting-in a well using the following data:
Data:Kick tolerance factor   = 1.68 ppg               Mud weight= 10.0 ppg
True vertical depth= 10,000 ft
Maximum FP, psi  = (1.68 ppg + 10.0 ppg) x 0.052 x 10,000 ft
Maximum FP        = 6074 psi
Maximum Influx Height Possible to Equal Maximum Allowable Shut-in
Casing Pressure (MASICP)

Determine barrels of influx opposite drill pipe:
Barrels = pit gain, bbl — barrels opposite drill collars
Barrels = 20 bbl — 13.1 bbl
Barrels = 6.9
Determine height of influx opposite drill pipe:

then: 1 — 3 ppg = gas kick
         4 — 6 ppg = oil kick or combination
         7 — 9 ppg = saltwater kick
Example:   Determine the type of the influx using the following data:
      Shut-in casing pressure= 1044 psi        Height of influx  = 400 ft
                 Shut-in drill pipe pressure = 780 psi          Mud weight    = 15.0 ppg
Influx weight, ppg = 15.0 ppg — ((1044 — 780)  :   400 x 0.052)
Influx weight, ppg = 15.0 ppg — 264
      20.8
Influx weight         = 2.31 ppg
Therefore, the influx is probably “gas.”

Vg = 12e
(—4.07)
Vg = 0.205 ft/sec
Vg = 0.205 ft/sec x 60 sec/min
Vg = 12.3 ft/min  x 60 min/hr

                                               pressure gradient of mud weight in use, psi/ft
Example:Determine the rate of gas migration with the following data:
Stabilised shut-in casing pressure    = 500 psi               SICP after one hour = 700 psi
Pressure gradient for 12.0 ppg mud =  0.624 psi/ft       Mud weight              = 12.0 ppg
Rate of gas migration, ft/hr = 200 psi/hr ÷ 0.624 psi/ft
Rate of gas migration        = 320.5 ft/hr

Gas Flow Into the Wellbore
Flow rate into the wellbore increases as wellbore depth through a gas sand increases:
Q = 0.007 x md x Dp x L  ÷  U  x  ln(Re Rw) 1,440
where  Q   = flow rate, bbl/min                                md = permeability, millidarcys
           Dp = pressure differential, psi                      L   = length of section open to wellbore, ft
           U   = viscosity of intruding gas, centipoise   Re  = radius of drainage, ft
           Rw = radius of wellbore, ft
Example:  md = 200 md       Dp = 624 psi     L =2Oft      U = 0.3cp      ln(Re ÷ Rw) = 2,0
Q = 0.007 x 200 x 624 x 20 ÷ 0.3 x 2.0 x 1440
Q = 20 bbl/min
Therefore:  If one minute is required to shut-in the well, a pit gain of ‘ 20 bbl occurs in
                  addition to the gain incurred while drilling the 20-ft section.

Breakover Point Between Stripping and Snubbing
Example: Use the following data to determine the breakover point:
DATA:   Mud weight                                       = 12.5 ppg
               Drill collars (6-1/4 in.— 2-13/16 in.) = 83 lb/ft
               Length of drill collars                        = 276 ft
               Drill pipe                                          = 5.0 in.
                 Drill pipe weight                             = 19.5 lb/ft
                 Shut-in casing pressure                   = 2400 psi
                 Buoyancy factor                             = 0.8092
Determine the force, lb, created by wellbore pressure on 6-1/4 in. drill collars:
Force, lb = (pipe or collar OD, In)
 2
  x  0.7854  x (wellbore pressure, psi)
Force, lb = 6.252 x 0.7854 x 2400 psi
Force   = 73,631 lb
Determine the weight, lb, of the drill collars:
Wt, lb = drill collar weight, lb/ft  x  drill collar length, ft  x  buoyancy factor
Wt, lb = 83 lb/ft x 276 ft x 0.8092
Wt, lb = 18,537 lb
Additional weight required from drill pipe:
Drill pipe weight, lb =force created by wellbore pressure, lb — drill collar weight, lb
Drill pipe weight, lb = 73,631 lb — 18,537 lb
Drill pipe weight, lb = 55,094 lb
Length of drill pipe required to reach breakover point:
Drill pipe = (required drill pipe weight, lb)  : 
  (drill pipe weight, lb/ft x factor buoyancy)
length, ft
Drill pipe length, ft = 55,094 lb  : 
 (19.5 lb/ft x 0.8092)
Drill pipe length, ft = 3492 ft
Length of drill string to reach breakover point:

where L      = length of pipe stripped, ft
           Cdp = capacity of drill pipe, drill collars, or tubing, bbl/ft
           Ddp = displacement of drill pipe, drill collars or tubing, bbl/ft
           Ca   = annular capacity, bbl/ft
Example:   If 300 ft of 5.0 in. drill pipe — 19.5 lb/ft is stripped into an influx in a 12-1/4 in.
                  hole, determine the height, ft, gained:
DATA:     Drill pipe capacity       = 0.01776 bbl/ft      Length drill pipe stripped = 300 ft
                 Drill pipe displacement = 0.00755 bbl/ft      Annular capacity   = 0.1215 bbl/ft
Solution:Height, ft = 300 (0.01776 + 0.00755)
                                                0.1215
                        Height    = 62.5 ft
Casing Pressure Increase From Stripping Into Influx
psi = (gain in height, ft) x (gradient of mud, psi/ft — gradient of  influx, psi/ft)
Example:       Gain in height                                    = 62.5 ft
                      Gradient of mud (12.5 ppg x 0.052)  = 0.65 psi/ft
           Gradient of influx                     = 0.12 psi/ft
psi = 62.5 ft x (0.65 — 0.12)

6.                          Subsea Considerations
Casing Pressure Decrease when Bringing Well on Choke
When bringing the well on choke with a subsea stack, the casing pressure (annulus pressure)
must be allowed to decrease by the amount of choke line pressure loss (friction pressure):
Reduced casing pressure, psi = (shut-in casing pressure, psi) — (choke line pressure loss, psi)
Example:     Shut-in casing (annulus) pressure (SICP) = 800 psi
                    Choke line pressure loss (CLPL)             = 300 psi
Reduced casing  pressure, psi = 800 psi — 300 psi
Reduced casing pressure         = 500 psi
Pressure Chart for Bringing Well on Choke
Pressure/stroke relationship is not a straight line effect. While bringing the well on choke, to
maintain a constant bottomhole pressure, the following chart should be used:
                                                                                    Pressure Chart

Casing Burst Pressure — Subsea Stack
Step 1  Determine the internal yield pressure of the casing from the “Dimensions and
              Strengths” section of cement company’s service handbook.
Step 2  Correct internal yield pressure for safety factor. Some operators use 80%; some use
              75%, and others use70%:
Correct internal yield pressure, psi = (internal yield pressure, psi ) x  SF
Step 3   Determine the hydrostatic pressure of the mud in use:
NOTE: The depth is from the rotary Kelly bushing (RKB) to the mud line and includes
               the air gap plus the depth of seawater.
HP, psi = (mud weight in use, ppg) x 0 052 x (TVD, ft from RKB to mud line)
Step 4   Determine the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the seawater:
HPsw = seawater weight, ppg x 0.052 x depth of seawater, ft

Step 5   Determine casing burst pressure (CBP):
CBP x  (corrected internal ) — (HP of mud in use, psi  + HP of seawater, psi)

                  Air gap         = 50 ft                  Water depth              = 1500 ft
                  Correction (safety) factor = 80%
Step 1     Determine the internal yield pressure of the casing from the “Dimension and
                 Strengths” section of a cement company handbook:
9-5/8” casing — C-75, 53.5 lb/ft
Internal yield pressure = 7430 psi
Step 2     Correct internal yield pressure for safety factor:
Corrected internal yield pressure = 7430 psi x 0.80
Corrected internal yield pressure = 5944 psi
Step 3     Determine the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the mud in use:
HP of mud, psi = 10.0 ppg x 0.052 x (50 ft + 1500 ft)

HPsw = 679 psi
Step 5   Determine the casing burst pressure:
Casing burst pressure, psi = 5944 psi — 806 psi + 679 psi

        New mud weight                  = 15.0 ppg
                    Old choke line pressure loss = 300 psi

Minimum Conductor Casing Setting Depth
Example:Using the following data, determine the minimum setting depth of the
conductor casing below the seabed:
Data:    Maximum mud weight (to be used while drilling this interval)   = 9.0 ppg
 Water depth     = 450 ft            Gradient of seawater                 = 0.445 psi/ft
             Air gap            = 60 ft              Formation fracture gradient       = 0.68 psi/ft
Step 1  Determine formation fracture pressure:
psi = (450 x 0.445) + (0.68 x “y”) psi = 200.25 + O.68”y”

Formulas and Calculations
117
Step 2  Determine hydrostatic pressure of mud column:
psi = 9.0 ppg x 0.052 x (60 + 450 + “y”)
psi = [9.0 x 0.052 x (60 + 450)] + (9.0 x 0.052 x “y”)
psi = 238.68 + 0.468 ”y”
Step 3  Minimum conductor casing setting depth:
200.25+ 0.68”y” = 238.68 + 0.468”y”
0.68”y” — 0.468”y” = 238.68 — 200.25
0.212”y” = 38.43
        “y” = 38.43
                  0.212
        “y” = 181.3 ft
Therefore, the minimum conductor casing setting depth is 181.3 ft below the seabed.
Maximum Mud Weight with Returns Back to Rig Floor
Example:     Using the following data, determine the maximum mud weight that can be
                    used with returns back to the rig floor:
Data:   Depths - Air gap         = 75 ft               Conductor casing psi/ft set at = 1225 ft RKB
            Depths - Water depth = 600ft             Formation fracture gradient     = 0.58 psi/ft
            Seawater gradient       = 0.445 psi/ft
Step 1  Determine total pressure at casing seat:
psi = [0.58 (1225 — 600 — 75)] + (0.445 x 600)
psi = 319 + 267
psi = 586
Step 2  Determine maximum mud weight:
Max mud wt = 586 psi 0.052 ÷ 1225 ft
Max mud wt = 9.2 ppg

                  if the riser is disconnected:
Data:Air gap                  = 75 ft                Water depth = 700 ft
            Seawater gradient = 0.445 psi/ft      Well depth    = 2020 ft RKB
            Mud weight          = 9.0 ppg

Formulas and Calculations
118
Step 1  Determine bottomhole pressure:
BHP = 9.0 ppg x 0.052 x 2020 ft
BHP = 945.4 psi
Step 2  Determine bottomhole pressure with riser disconnected:
BHP = (0.445 x 700) + [9.0 x 0.052 x (2020 — 700 — 75)]
BHP = 311.5 + 582.7
BHP = 894.2 psi
Step 3  Determine bottomhole pressure reduction:
BHP reduction = 945.4 psi — 894.2 psi
BHP reduction = 51.2 psi
Bottomhole Pressure When Circulating Out a Kick
Example:   Use the following data and determine the bottomhole pressure when circulating
                  out a kick:
Data:Total depth — RKB                     = 13,500 ft     Gas gradient                   = 0.12 psi/ft
            Height of gas kick in casing         = 1200 ft         Kill weight mud             = 12.7 ppg
            Original mud weight                    = 12.0 ppg      Pressure loss in annulus  = 75 psi
            Choke line pressure loss              = 220 psi         Air gap                           = 75 ft
Annulus (casing) pressure            = 631 psi         Water depth                   = 1500 ft
            Original mud in casing below gas = 5500 ft
Step 1   Hydrostatic pressure in choke line:
psi = 12.0 ppg x 0.052 x (1500 + 75)
psi = 982.8
Step 2  Hydrostatic pressure exerted by gas influx:
psi = 0.12 psi/ft x 1200 ft
psi = 144
Step 3  Hydrostatic pressure of original mud below gas influx:
psi = 12.0 ppg x 0.052 x 5500 ft
psi = 3432
Step 4  Hydrostatic pressure of kill weight mud:
psi = 12.7 ppg x 0.052 x (13,500 — 5500 — 1200 — 1500 — 75)
psi = 12.7 ppg x 0.052 x 5225

7.                       Workover Operations
NOTE:    The following procedures and calculations are more commonly used in workover
                 operations, but at times they are used in drilling operations.
Bullheading
Bullheading is a term used to describe killing the well by forcing formation fluids back into the
formation by pumping kill weight fluid down the tubing and in some cases down the casing.
The Bullheading method of killing a well is primarily used in the following situations:
a) Tubing in the well with a packer set. No communication exists between tubing and annulus.
b) Tubing in the well, influx in the annulus, and for some reason, cannot circulate through the
     tubing.
c)  No tubing in the well. Influx in the casing. Bullheading is simplest, fastest, and safest
    method to use to kill the well.
NOTE:  Tubing could be well off bottom also.
d)  In drilling operations, bullheading has been used successfully in areas where hydrogen
    sulphide is a possibility.
Example calculations involved in bullheading operations:
Using the information given below, the necessary calculations will be performed to kill the
well by bullheading. The example calculations will pertain to “a” above:

= 0.00579 bbl/ft
= 7260 psi
= 8.4 ppg
NOTE:  Determine the best pump rate to use. The pump rate must exceed the rate of gas
               bubble migration up the tubing. The rate of gas bubble migration, ft/hr, in a shut-in
               well can be determined by the following formula:
Rate of gas migration, ft/hr =increase in pressure per/hr, psi 
                                               completion fluid gradient, psi/ft
Solution:  Calculate the maximum allowable tubing (surface) pressure (MATP) for formation
                fracture:
a) MATP, initial, with influx in the tubing:
MATP, initial = (fracture gradient, psi/ft x  depth of perforations, ft) — (tubing hydrostatic)
                                                                                                               (pressure, psi        )
MATP, initial = (0.862 psi/ft x 6480 ft) — 326 psi
MATP, initial = 5586 psi — 326 psi
MATP, initial = 5260 psi
b) MATP, final, with kill fluid in tubing:
MATP, final = (fracture gradient, psi/ft  x  depth of perforations, ft) — (tubing hydrostatic)
                                                                                                              (pressure, psi        )
MATP, final = (0.862 x 6480) — (8.4 x 0.052 x 6480)
MATP, final = 5586 psi — 2830 psi
MATP, final = 2756 psi
Determine tubing capacity:
Tubing capacity, bbl = tubing length, ft x tubing capacity, bbl/ft
Tubing capacity bbl, = 6480 ft x 0.00579 bbl/ft
Tubing capacity        = 37.5 bbl

Plot these values as shown below:
Figure 4-3. Tubing pressure profile.
Lubricate and Bleed
The lubricate and bleed method involves alternately pumping a kill fluid into the tubing
or  into  the  casing  if  there  is  no  tubing  in  the  well,  allowing  the  kill  fluid  to  fall,  then  bleeding
off  a  volume  of  gas  until  kill  fluid  reaches  the  choke.  As  each  volume  of  kill  fluid  is  pumped
into  the  tubing,  the  SITP  should  decrease  by  a  calculated  value  until  the  well  is  eventually
killed.
This  method  is  often  used  for  two  reasons:  1)  shut-in  pressures  approach  the  rated
working  pressure  of  the  wellhead  or  tubing  and  dynamic  pumping  pressure  may  exceed  the
limits, as in the case of bullheading, and 2) either to completely kill the well or lower the SITP
to a value where other kill methods can be safely employed without exceeding rated limits.
This  method  can  also  be  applied  when  the  wellbore  or  perforations  are  lugged,
rendering bullheading useless. In this case, the well can be killed without necessitating the use
of tubing or snubbing small diameter tubing.
Users  should  be  aware  that  the  lubricate  and  bleed  method  is  often  a  very  time
consuming process, whereas another method may kill the well more quickly. The following is
an example of a typical lubricate and bleed kill procedure.

Formulas and Calculations
122
Example:   A workover is planned for a well where the SITP approaches the working pressure
                  of the wellhead equipment. To minimise the possibility of equipment failure, the
                  lubricate and bleed method will be used to reduce the SITP to a level at which
                  bullheading can be safely conducted. The data below will be used to describe this
                  procedure:
TVD                         = 6500 ft         Depth of perforations          = 6450 ft
SITP                         = 2830 psi       Tubing   6.5 lb/ft-N-80        = 2-7/8 in.
Kill fluid density       = 9.0 ppg          Wellhead working pressure = 3000 psi
Tubing internal yield = 10,570 psi     Tubing capacity        = 0.00579 bbl/ft (172.76 ft/bbl)
Calculations:     Calculate the expected pressure reduction for each barrel of kill fluid pumped:
psi/bbl = tubing capacity, ft/bbl x 0.052 x kill weight fluid, ppg
psi/bbl = 172.76 ft/bbl x 0.052 x 9.0 ppg
psi/bbl = 80.85
For each one barrel pumped, the SITP will be reduced by 80.85 psi.
Calculate tubing capacity, bbl, to the perforations:
bbl = tubing capacity, bbl/ft x depth to perforations, ft
bbl = 0.00579 bbl/ft x 6450 ft
bbl = 37.3 bbl
Procedure:
1. Rig up all surface equipment including pumps and gas flare lines.
2. Record SITP and SICP.
3. Open the choke to allow gas to escape from the well and momentarily reduce the SITP.
4. Close the choke and pump in 9.0 ppg brine until the tubing pressure reaches 2830 psi.
5. Wait for a period of time to allow the brine to fall in the tubing. This period will range
    from 1/4 to 1 hour depending on gas density, pressure, and tubing size.
6. Open the choke and bleed gas until 9.0 brine begins to escape.
7. Close the choke and pump in 9.0 ppg brine water.
8. Continue the process until a low level, safe working pressure is attained.
A  certain  amount  of  time  is  required  for  the  kill  fluid  to  fall  down  the  tubing  after  the
pumping  stops.  The  actual  waiting  time  is  not  to  allow  fluid  to  fall,  but  rather,  for  gas  to
migrate  up  through  the  kill  fluid.  Gas  migrates  at  rates  of  1000  to  2000  ft/hr.  Therefore
considerable time is required for fluid to fall or migrate to 6500 ft. Therefore, after pumping, it
is  important  to  wait  several  minutes  before  bleeding  gas  to  prevent  bleeding  off  kill  fluid
through the choke.

NOTE:     Usually the nozzle size will have a decimal fraction. The fraction times 3 will
                 determine how many nozzles should be larger than that calculated.
a)  For impact force:                   0.76  x 3 = 2.28 rounded to 2
                                                   so: 1 jet   = 10/32nds
                                                         2 jets = 11/32nds
b) For hydraulic horsepower:      0.03 x 3 = 0.09 rounded to 0
                                                   so: 3 jets = 9/32 nd in.

4.                               “d” Exponent
The “d” exponent is derived from the general drilling equation:     R ÷ N = a (W

 ÷ D)
where  R = penetration rate                 d = exponent in general drilling equation, dimensionless
           N = rotary speed, rpm              a = a constant, dimensionless
          W = weight on bit, lb
“d” exponent equation:     “d”  =  log (R ÷ 60N) ÷ log (12W ÷ 1000D)
where    d = d exponent, dimensionless    R  = penetration rate, ft/hr
             N = rotary speed, rpm                 W = weight on bit, 1,000 lb
             D = bit size, in.
Example:  R  = 30 ft/hr           N = 120 rpm        W = 35,000 lb        D = 8.5 in.
Solution:d = log [30 ÷ (60 x 120)] ÷ log [(12 x 35) (1000 x 8.5)]
            d = log (30 ÷ 7200) ÷ log (420 ÷ 8500)
            d = log 0.0042 ÷ log 0.0494

9. Fracture Gradient Determination - Subsea Applications
In offshore drilling operations, it is necessary to correct the calculated fracture gradient
for the effect of water depth and flow-line height (air gap) above mean sea level. The
following procedure can be used:
Example:   Air gap         = 100 ft                Density of seawater                = 8.9 ppg
      Water depth = 2000 ft               Feet of casing below mud-line = 4000 ft
Procedure:
1. Convert water to equivalent land area, ft:
a) Determine the hydrostatic pressure of the seawater:   HPsw = 8.9 ppg x 0.052 x 2000 ft
                                                                                      HPsw = 926 psi
b) From Eaton’s Overburden Stress Chart, determine the overburden stress gradient from
    mean sea level to casing setting depth:
    From chart: Enter chart at 6000 ft on left; intersect curved line and read overburden
                      gradient at bottom of chart:
    Overburden stress gradient = 0.92 psi/ft
c) Determine equivalent land area, ft:             Equivalent feet = 926 psi
                                                                                                 0.92 psi/ft

3. Using Eaton’s Fracture Gradient Chart, determine the fracture gradient at a depth
    of 5006 ft:
    From chart: Enter chart at a depth of 5006 ft; intersect the 9.0 ppg line; then proceed up
                       and read the fracture gradient at the top of the chart:
    Fracture gradient = 14.7 ppg
4. Determine the fracture pressure:                                    psi = 14.7 ppg x 0.052 x 5006 ft
                                                                                         psi = 3827
5. Convert the fracture gradient relative to the flow-line:    Fc = 3827 psi 0.052 ÷ 6100 ft
                                                                                          Fc = 12.06 ppg
where Fc is the fracture gradient, corrected for water depth, and air gap.

Directional Survey Calculations
The following are the two most commonly used methods to calculate directional surveys:
1. Angle Averaging Method
North = MD x sin.(I1 + I2) x  cos.(Al + A2)
                                 2                       2
East = MD x sin.(I1 + I2) x  sin.(Al + A2)
                                 2                       2
Vert. = MD x cos.(I1 + I2)
                                 2

2. Radius of Curvature Method
North =  MD(cos. I1 — cos. I2)(sin. A2 — sin. Al)
                        (I2 — I1)(A2 — Al)
East =  MD(cos. I1 — cos. I2)(cos. A2 — cos. Al)
                        (I2 — I1)(A2 — Al)
Vert. =  MD(sin. I2 — sin. I1)
                        (I2 — I1)
where    MD      = course length between surveys in measured depth, ft
  I1, I2    = inclination (angle) at upper and lower surveys, degrees
  A1, A2 = direction at upper and lower surveys
Example:  Use the Angle Averaging Method and the Radius of Curvature Method to
                 calculate the following surveys:

Deviation/Departure Calculation
Deviation is defined as departure of the wellbore from the vertical, measured by the
horizontal distance from the rotary table to the target. The amount of deviation is a function of
the drift angle (inclination) and hole depth.

Formulas and Calculations
150
The following diagram illustrates how to determine the deviation/departure:
DATA:
AB =  distance from the surface location to the KOP
BC =  distance from KOP to the true vertical depth
          (TVD)
BD = distance from KOP to the bottom of the hole
          (MD)
CD = Deviation/departure—departure of the
          wellbore from the vertical
AC = true vertical depth
AD = Measured depth
Figure 5-4.  Deviation/Departure
To calculate the deviation/departure (CD), ft:       CD, ft = sin I x BD
Example: Kick off point (KOP) is a distance 2000 ft from the surface.
                MD is 8000 ft. Hole angle (inclination) is 20 degrees.
                Therefore the distance from KOP to MD = 6000 ft (BD):
CD, ft = sin 20 x 6000 ft
CD, ft = 0.342 x 6000 ft
CD     = 2052 ft
From this calculation, the measured depth (MD) is 2052 ft away from vertical.
Dogleg Severity Calculation
Method 1
Dogleg severity (DLS) is usually given in degrees/100 ft. The following formula
provides dogleg severity in degrees/100 ft and is based on the Radius of Curvature Method:
DLS = {cos.
—1
 [(cos. I1 x cos. I2) + (sin. I1 x sin. 12) x cos. (A2 — Al)]} x (100 ÷ CL)
For metric calculation, substitute  x (30 ÷ CL) i.e.
DLS = {cos.
—1
 [(cos. I1 x cos. I2) + (sin. I1 x sin. 12) x cos. (A2 — Al)]} x (30 ÷ CL)
where       DLS          = dogleg severity, degrees/l00 ft
                 CL            = course length, distance between survey points, ft
                 I1, I2        = inclination (angle) at upper and lower surveys, ft
                 Al, A2      = direction at upper and lower surveys, degrees
                 ^Azimuth = azimuth change between surveys, degrees

DLS = 2.4960847 x (100 ÷ 31)
DLS = 8.051886 degrees/100 ft
Method 2
This method of calculating dogleg severity is based on the tangential method:
DLS =                                              100                                          .
             L [(sin. I1 x sin. I2)(sin. A1 x sin. A2 + cos.  A1 x cos. A2) + cos. I1 x cos. I2]
where   DLS     = dogleg severity, degrees/ 100 ft
            L          = course length, ft
            Il, 12    = inclination (angle) at upper and lower surveys, degrees
            Al, A2  = direction at upper and lower surveys, degrees

Available Weight on Bit in Directional Wells
A directionally drilled well requires that a correction be made in total drill collar weight
because only a portion of the total weight will be available to the bit:
P = W x Cos I
where     P = partial weight available for bit            Cos = cosine
   I = degrees inclination (angle)                  W    = total weight of collars

Formulas and Calculations
152
Example:       W = 45,000 lb         I = 25 degrees
P = 45,000 x cos 25
P = 45,000 x 0.9063
P = 40,784 lb
Thus, the available weight on bit is 40,784 lb.
Determining True Vertical Depth
The following is a simple method of correcting for the TVD on directional wells. This
calculation will give the approximate TVD interval corresponding to the measured interval and
is generally accurate enough for any pressure calculations. At the next survey, the TVD should
be corrected to correspond to the directional Driller’s calculated true vertical depth:
TVD
2 
= cos I x CL + TVD
1
where   TVD
2 
= new true vertical depth, ft
            TVD
1
 = last true vertical depth, ft
            CL     = course length — number of feet since last survey
            cos    = cosine
Example:    TVD (last survey) = 8500 ft           Deviation angle  = 40 degrees
       Course length        = 30 ft
Solution:     TVD
2 
= cos 40 x 30 ft + 8500 ft
                   TVD
2 
= 0.766 x 30 ft + 8500 ft
                   TVD
2 
= 22.98 ft + 8500 ft
                   TVD
2 
= 8522.98 ft

To convert volume, ft
3
. to barrels, multiply by 0.1781.
To convert volume, ft
3
, to gallons, multiply by 7.4805.
Therefore, 2 feet of fluid in this tank would result in;
Volume, bbl  = 294 ft
3 
x 0.1781
Volume         = 52.36 bbl
NOTE:  This is only applicable until the tank is half full (r — h). After that,
              calculate total volume of the tank and subtract the empty space.
              The empty space can be calculated by h = height of empty space.
