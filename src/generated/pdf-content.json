These are the actual ton-miles of work in drilling down the\nlength of a section of drill pipe (usually approximately 30 ft) plus picking up, connecting, and\nstarting to drill with the next section.\nTo determine connection or drilling ton-miles, take 3 times (ton-miles for current round trip\nminus ton-miles for previous round trip):\nTd = 3(T\n2 \n— T\n1\n)\nwhere  Td = drilling or “connection” ton-miles\n            T\n2  \n= ton-miles for one round trip — depth where drilling stopped before coming out\n                    of hole.\n            T\n1 \n= ton-miles for one round trip — depth where drilling started.\nExample:   Ton-miles for trip @ 4600 ft = 64.6   Ton-miles for trip @ 4000 ft = 53.7\nTd = 3 x (64.6 — 53.7)\nTd = 3 x 10.9\nTd = 32.7 ton-miles\nTon-miles during coring operations\nThe ton-miles of work performed in coring operations, as for drilling operations, is expressed\nin terms of work performed in making round trips.\nTo determine ton-miles while coring, take 2 times ton-miles for one round trip at the depth\nwhere coring stopped minus ton-miles for one round trip at the depth where coring began:\nTc = 2 (T\n4 \n— T\n3\n)\nwhere Tc =  ton-miles while coring\n           T\n4 \n=  ton-miles for one round trip — depth where coring stopped before coming out of\n                    hole\n           T\n3 \n=  ton-miles for one round trip — depth where coring started after going in hole\nTon-miles setting casing\nThe  calculations  of  the  ton-miles  for  the  operation  of  setting  casing  should  be  determined  as\nfor  drill  pipe,  but  with  the  buoyed  weight  of  the  casing  being  used,  and  with  the  result  being\nmultiplied  by  one-half,  because  setting  casing  is  a  one-way  (1/2  round  trip)  operation.  Ton-\nmiles for setting casing can be determined from the following formula:\nTc =  Wp x D x (Lcs + D) + D x Wb  x 0.5\n                         5280 x 2000\nwhere  Tc  = ton-miles setting casing                 Wp = buoyed weight of casing, lb/ft\n           Lcs = length of one joint of casing, ft      Wb = weight of travelling block assembly, lb\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n37\nTon-miles while making short trip\nThe ton-miles of work performed in short trip operations, as for drilling and coring operations,\nis  also  expressed  in  terms  of  round  trips.  Analysis  shows  that  the  ton-miles  of  work  done  in\nmaking  a  short  trip  is  equal  to  the  difference  in  round  trip  ton-miles  for  the  two  depths  in\nquestion.\nTst = T\n6 \n— T\n5\nwhere   Tst =  ton-miles for short trip\n              T\n6 \n=  ton-miles for one round trip at the deeper depth, the depth of the bit before\n                       starting the short trip.\n              T\n5 \n=  ton-miles for one round trip at the shallower depth, the depth that the bit is\n                       pulled up to.\n7.

Data from kill sheet.\nNote.After pumping 1062 strokes, if a straight line would have been plotted, the well would\nhave been underbalanced by 178 psi.\nKill Sheet for a Highly Deviated Well\nWhenever a kick is taken in a highly deviated well, the circulating pressure can be\nexcessive when the kill weight mud gets to the kick-off point (KOP). If the pressure is\nexcessive, the pressure schedule should be divided into two sections: 1) from surface to KOP,\nand 2) from KOP to TD. The following calculations are used:\nDetermine strokes from surface to KOP:\nStrokes = drill pipe capacity, bbl!ft  x  measured depth to KOP, ft  x   pump output,  bbl/stk\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n90\nDetermine strokes from KOP to TD:\nStrokes = drill string capacity, bbl/ftx  measured depth to TD, ft  x  pump output, bbl/stk\nKill weight mud:                         KWM = SIDPP ÷ 0.052 ÷ TVD + OMW\nInitial circulating pressure:          ICP = SIDPP + KRP\nFinal circulating pressure:           FCP KWM x KRP ÷ 0MW\nHydrostatic pressure increase from surface to KOP:\npsi = (KWM - OMW) x 0.052 x TVD @ KOP\nFriction pressure increase to KOP:\nFP = (FCP - KRP) x MD @ KOP ÷ MD @ TD\nCirculating pressure when KWM gets to KOP:\nCP ~ KOP = ICP — HP increase to KOP + friction pressure\nincrease, psi\nNote:At this point, compare this circulating pressure to the value obtained when using a\nregular kill sheet.\nExample:    Original mud weight (OMW)           = 9.6 ppg\n                   Measured depth (MD)                     = 15,000 ft\n                   Measured depth @ KOP                  = 5000 ft\n                   True vertical depth @ KOP             = 5000 ft\n       Kill rate pressure (KRP) @ 30 spm  = 600 psi\n        Pump output                                    = 0.136 bbl/stk\n                   Drill pipe capacity                            = 0.01776 bbl/ft\n       Shut-in drill pipe pressure (SIDPP)  = 800 psi\n                   True vertical depth (TVD)               = 10,000 ft\nSolution:\nStrokes from surface to KOP:\nStrokes = 0.01776 bbl/ft x 5000 ft ÷ 0.136 bbl/stk\nStrokes = 653\nStrokes from KOP to TD:\nStrokes = 0.01776 bbl/ft x 10,000 ft + 0.136 bbl/stk\nStrokes = 1306\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n91\nTotal strokes from surface to bit:\nSurface to bit strokes = 653 + 1306\nSurface to bit strokes = 1959\nKill weight mud (KWM):\nKWM = 800 psi 0.052 + 10,000 ft + 9.6 ppg\nKWM = 11.1 ppg\nInitial circulating pressure (ICP):\nICP = 800 psi + 600 psi\nICP = 1400 psi\nFinal circulating pressure (FCP):\nFCP = 11.1 ppg x 600 psi ± 9.6 ppg\nFCP = 694 psi\nHydrostatic pressure increase from surface to KOP:\nHPi = (11.1 — 9.6) x 0.052 x 5000\nHPi = 390 psi\nFriction pressure increase to TD:\nFP = (694 — 600) x 5000 ÷ 15,000\nFP = 31 psi\nCirculating pressure when KWM gets to KOP:\nCP = 1400 — 390 + 31\nCP = 1041 psi\nCompare this circulating pressure to the value obtained when using a regular kill sheet:\npsi/stk = 1400 — 694 + 1959\npsi/stk = 0.36\n0.36psi/stk x 653 strokes = 235 psi\n1400 — 235 = 1165 psi\nUsing a regular kill sheet, the circulating drill pipe pressure would be 1165 psi. The\nadjusted pressure chart would have 1041 psi on the drill pipe gauge. This represents 124 psi\ndifference in pressure, which would also be observed on the annulus (casing) side. It is\nrecommended that if the difference in pressure at the KOP is 100 psi or greater, then the\nadjusted pressure chart should be used to minimise the chances of losing circulation.\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n92\nThe chart below graphically illustrates the difference:\nFigure 4—2. Adjusted pressure chart.\n2.                        Pre-recorded Information\nMaximum Anticipated Surface Pressure\nTwo methods are commonly used to determine maximum anticipated surface pressure:\nMethod 1:  Use when assuming the maximum formation pressure is from\n                   TD:\nStep 1  Determine maximum formation pressure (FPmax):\nFP max = (maximum mud wt to be used, ppg + safety factor, ppg) x 0.052 x (total depth, ft)\nStep 2  Assuming 100% of the mud is blown out of the hole, determine the hydrostatic\n              pressure in the wellbore:\nNote:70% to 80% of mud being blown out is sometimes used instead of l00%.\nHPgas = gas gradient, psi/ft x total depth, ft\nStep 3  Determine maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP):\nMASP = FPmax — HPgas\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n93\nExample:       Proposed total depth                                              = 12,000 ft\n                      Maximum mud weight to be used in drilling well    = 12.0 ppg\n                      Safety factor                                                          = 4.0 ppg\n                      Gas gradient                                                          =  0.12 psi/ft\nAssume that 100% of mud is blown out of well.\nStep 1   Determine fracture pressure, psi:\nFPmax = (12.0 + 4.0) x 0.052 x 12,000 ft\nFPmax = 9984 psi\nStep 2\nHPgas = 0.12 x 12,000 ft\nHPgas = 1440 psi\nStep 3\nMASP = 9984 — 1440\nMASP = 8544 psi\nMethod 2: Use when assuming the maximum pressure in the wellbore is\n                  attained when the formation at the shoe fractures:\nStep 1\nFracture, psi  =  (estimated fracture + safety factor, ppg) x 0.052 x (casing shoe TVD, ft)\npressure             (gradient, ppg                                       )\nNote:A safety factor is added to ensure the formation fractures before BOP pressure rating\nis exceeded.\nStep 2   Determine the hydrostatic pressure of gas in the wellbore (HPgas):\nHPgas = gas gradient, psi/ft x casing shoe TVD, ft\nStep 3   Determine the maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP), psi:\nExample:    Proposed casing setting depth    = 4000 ft\n                  Estimated fracture gradient         = 14.2 ppg\n                  Safety factor                               = 1.0 ppg\n                  Gas gradient                               =  0.12 psi/ft\nAssume 100°/ of mud is blown out of the hole.\nStep 1    Fracture pressure, psi  = (14.2 + 1.0) x 0.052 x 4000 ft\n                 Fracture pressure, psi  = 3162 psi\nStep 2    HPgas = 0.12 x 4000 ft\n                 HPgas = 480 psi\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n94\nStep 3    MASP = 3162 — 480\n                 MASP = 2682 psi\nSizing Diverter Lines\nDetermine diverter line inside diameter, in., equal to the area between the inside diameter of\nthe casing and the outside diameter of drill pipe in use:\nDiverter line ID, in. = ~Ib~bp2\nExample:   Casing— 13-3/8 in. — J-55 — 61 IbIft ID = 12.515 in.\n                  Drill pipe — 19.5 lb/ft OD                          = 5.0 in.\nDetermine the diverter line inside diameter that will equal the area between the casing and drill\npipe:\nDiverter line ID, in. = sq. root (12.515\n2\n — 5.0\n2\n)\nDiverter line ID = 11.47 in.\nFormation Pressure Tests\nTwo methods of testing:          •Equivalent mud weight test\n •Leak-off test\nPrecautions to be undertaken before testing:\n1.        Circulate and condition the mud to ensure the mud weight is consistent throughout the\n           system.\n2.        Change the pressure gauge (if possible) to a smaller increment gauge so a more\n           accurate measure can be determined.\n3.        Shut-in the well.\n4.        Begin pumping at a very slow rate — 1/4 to 1/2 bbl/min.\n5.        Monitor pressure, time, and barrels pumped.\n6.        Some operators may have different procedures in running this test, others may\n           include:\na.

No communication exists between tubing and annulus.\nb) Tubing in the well, influx in the annulus, and for some reason, cannot circulate through the\n     tubing.\nc)  No tubing in the well.

Tubing pressure profile.\nLubricate and Bleed\nThe lubricate and bleed method involves alternately pumping a kill fluid into the tubing\nor  into  the  casing  if  there  is  no  tubing  in  the  well,  allowing  the  kill  fluid  to  fall,  then  bleeding\noff  a  volume  of  gas  until  kill  fluid  reaches  the  choke.  As  each  volume  of  kill  fluid  is  pumped\ninto  the  tubing,  the  SITP  should  decrease  by  a  calculated  value  until  the  well  is  eventually\nkilled.\nThis  method  is  often  used  for  two  reasons:  1)  shut-in  pressures  approach  the  rated\nworking  pressure  of  the  wellhead  or  tubing  and  dynamic  pumping  pressure  may  exceed  the\nlimits, as in the case of bullheading, and 2) either to completely kill the well or lower the SITP\nto a value where other kill methods can be safely employed without exceeding rated limits.\nThis  method  can  also  be  applied  when  the  wellbore  or  perforations  are  lugged,\nrendering bullheading useless. In this case, the well can be killed without necessitating the use\nof tubing or snubbing small diameter tubing.\nUsers  should  be  aware  that  the  lubricate  and  bleed  method  is  often  a  very  time\nconsuming process, whereas another method may kill the well more quickly. The following is\nan example of a typical lubricate and bleed kill procedure.\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n122\nExample:   A workover is planned for a well where the SITP approaches the working pressure\n                  of the wellhead equipment. To minimise the possibility of equipment failure, the\n                  lubricate and bleed method will be used to reduce the SITP to a level at which\n                  bullheading can be safely conducted. The data below will be used to describe this\n                  procedure:\nTVD                         = 6500 ft         Depth of perforations          = 6450 ft\nSITP                         = 2830 psi       Tubing   6.5 lb/ft-N-80        = 2-7/8 in.\nKill fluid density       = 9.0 ppg          Wellhead working pressure = 3000 psi\nTubing internal yield = 10,570 psi     Tubing capacity        = 0.00579 bbl/ft (172.76 ft/bbl)\nCalculations:     Calculate the expected pressure reduction for each barrel of kill fluid pumped:\npsi/bbl = tubing capacity, ft/bbl x 0.052 x kill weight fluid, ppg\npsi/bbl = 172.76 ft/bbl x 0.052 x 9.0 ppg\npsi/bbl = 80.85\nFor each one barrel pumped, the SITP will be reduced by 80.85 psi.\nCalculate tubing capacity, bbl, to the perforations:\nbbl = tubing capacity, bbl/ft x depth to perforations, ft\nbbl = 0.00579 bbl/ft x 6450 ft\nbbl = 37.3 bbl\nProcedure:\n1. Rig up all surface equipment including pumps and gas flare lines.\n2. Record SITP and SICP.\n3. Open the choke to allow gas to escape from the well and momentarily reduce the SITP.\n4. Close the choke and pump in 9.0 ppg brine until the tubing pressure reaches 2830 psi.\n5. Wait for a period of time to allow the brine to fall in the tubing. This period will range\n    from 1/4 to 1 hour depending on gas density, pressure, and tubing size.\n6. Open the choke and bleed gas until 9.0 brine begins to escape.\n7. Close the choke and pump in 9.0 ppg brine water.\n8. Continue the process until a low level, safe working pressure is attained.\nA  certain  amount  of  time  is  required  for  the  kill  fluid  to  fall  down  the  tubing  after  the\npumping  stops.  The  actual  waiting  time  is  not  to  allow  fluid  to  fall,  but  rather,  for  gas  to\nmigrate  up  through  the  kill  fluid.  Gas  migrates  at  rates  of  1000  to  2000  ft/hr.  Therefore\nconsiderable time is required for fluid to fall or migrate to 6500 ft. Therefore, after pumping, it\nis  important  to  wait  several  minutes  before  bleeding  gas  to  prevent  bleeding  off  kill  fluid\nthrough the choke.\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n123\nReferences\nAdams, Neal, Well Control Problems and Solutions, PennWell Publishing Company, Tulsa,\n   OK, 1980.\nAdams, Neal, Workover Well Control, PennWell Publishing Company, Tulsa, OK, 1984.\nGoldsmith, Riley, Why Gas Cut Mud Is Not Always a Serious Problem, World Oil, Oct. 1972.\nGrayson, Richard and Fred S.

The amount of deviation is a function of\nthe drift angle (inclination) and hole depth.\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n150\nThe following diagram illustrates how to determine the deviation/departure:\nDATA:\nAB =  distance from the surface location to the KOP\nBC =  distance from KOP to the true vertical depth\n          (TVD)\nBD = distance from KOP to the bottom of the hole\n          (MD)\nCD = Deviation/departure—departure of the\n          wellbore from the vertical\nAC = true vertical depth\nAD = Measured depth\nFigure 5-4.  Deviation/Departure\nTo calculate the deviation/departure (CD), ft:       CD, ft = sin I x BD\nExample: Kick off point (KOP) is a distance 2000 ft from the surface.\n                MD is 8000 ft. Hole angle (inclination) is 20 degrees.\n                Therefore the distance from KOP to MD = 6000 ft (BD):\nCD, ft = sin 20 x 6000 ft\nCD, ft = 0.342 x 6000 ft\nCD     = 2052 ft\nFrom this calculation, the measured depth (MD) is 2052 ft away from vertical.\nDogleg Severity Calculation\nMethod 1\nDogleg severity (DLS) is usually given in degrees/100 ft. The following formula\nprovides dogleg severity in degrees/100 ft and is based on the Radius of Curvature Method:\nDLS = {cos.\n—1\n [(cos. I1 x cos. I2) + (sin. I1 x sin. 12) x cos. (A2 — Al)]} x (100 ÷ CL)\nFor metric calculation, substitute  x (30 ÷ CL) i.e.\nDLS = {cos.\n—1\n [(cos. I1 x cos. I2) + (sin. I1 x sin. 12) x cos. (A2 — Al)]} x (30 ÷ CL)\nwhere       DLS          = dogleg severity, degrees/l00 ft\n                 CL            = course length, distance between survey points, ft\n                 I1, I2        = inclination (angle) at upper and lower surveys, ft\n                 Al, A2      = direction at upper and lower surveys, degrees\n                 ^Azimuth = azimuth change between surveys, degrees\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n151\nExample:                            Survey 1                         Survey 2\nDepth, ft42314262\nInclination, degrees13.514.7\nAzimuth, degreesN 10 EN 19 E\nDLS = {cos.\n—1 \n[(cos. 13.5 x cos. l4.7) + (sin. 13.5 x sin. 14.7 x cos.

This\ncalculation will give the approximate TVD interval corresponding to the measured interval and\nis generally accurate enough for any pressure calculations. At the next survey, the TVD should\nbe corrected to correspond to the directional Driller’s calculated true vertical depth:\nTVD\n2 \n= cos I x CL + TVD\n1\nwhere   TVD\n2 \n= new true vertical depth, ft\n            TVD\n1\n = last true vertical depth, ft\n            CL     = course length — number of feet since last survey\n            cos    = cosine\nExample:    TVD (last survey) = 8500 ft           Deviation angle  = 40 degrees\n       Course length        = 30 ft\nSolution:     TVD\n2 \n= cos 40 x 30 ft + 8500 ft\n                   TVD\n2 \n= 0.766 x 30 ft + 8500 ft\n                   TVD\n2 \n= 22.98 ft + 8500 ft\n                   TVD\n2 \n= 8522.98 ft\n11.

These are the actual ton-miles of work in drilling down the\nlength of a section of drill pipe (usually approximately 30 ft) plus picking up, connecting, and\nstarting to drill with the next section.\nTo determine connection or drilling ton-miles, take 3 times (ton-miles for current round trip\nminus ton-miles for previous round trip):\nTd = 3(T\n2 \n— T\n1\n)\nwhere  Td = drilling or “connection” ton-miles\n            T\n2  \n= ton-miles for one round trip — depth where drilling stopped before coming out\n                    of hole.\n            T\n1 \n= ton-miles for one round trip — depth where drilling started.\nExample:   Ton-miles for trip @ 4600 ft = 64.6   Ton-miles for trip @ 4000 ft = 53.7\nTd = 3 x (64.6 — 53.7)\nTd = 3 x 10.9\nTd = 32.7 ton-miles\nTon-miles during coring operations\nThe ton-miles of work performed in coring operations, as for drilling operations, is expressed\nin terms of work performed in making round trips.\nTo determine ton-miles while coring, take 2 times ton-miles for one round trip at the depth\nwhere coring stopped minus ton-miles for one round trip at the depth where coring began:\nTc = 2 (T\n4 \n— T\n3\n)\nwhere Tc =  ton-miles while coring\n           T\n4 \n=  ton-miles for one round trip — depth where coring stopped before coming out of\n                    hole\n           T\n3 \n=  ton-miles for one round trip — depth where coring started after going in hole\nTon-miles setting casing\nThe  calculations  of  the  ton-miles  for  the  operation  of  setting  casing  should  be  determined  as\nfor  drill  pipe,  but  with  the  buoyed  weight  of  the  casing  being  used,  and  with  the  result  being\nmultiplied  by  one-half,  because  setting  casing  is  a  one-way  (1/2  round  trip)  operation.  Ton-\nmiles for setting casing can be determined from the following formula:\nTc =  Wp x D x (Lcs + D) + D x Wb  x 0.5\n                         5280 x 2000\nwhere  Tc  = ton-miles setting casing                 Wp = buoyed weight of casing, lb/ft\n           Lcs = length of one joint of casing, ft      Wb = weight of travelling block assembly, lb\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n37\nTon-miles while making short trip\nThe ton-miles of work performed in short trip operations, as for drilling and coring operations,\nis  also  expressed  in  terms  of  round  trips.  Analysis  shows  that  the  ton-miles  of  work  done  in\nmaking  a  short  trip  is  equal  to  the  difference  in  round  trip  ton-miles  for  the  two  depths  in\nquestion.\nTst = T\n6 \n— T\n5\nwhere   Tst =  ton-miles for short trip\n              T\n6 \n=  ton-miles for one round trip at the deeper depth, the depth of the bit before\n                       starting the short trip.\n              T\n5 \n=  ton-miles for one round trip at the shallower depth, the depth that the bit is\n                       pulled up to.\n7.

Data from kill sheet.\nNote.After pumping 1062 strokes, if a straight line would have been plotted, the well would\nhave been underbalanced by 178 psi.\nKill Sheet for a Highly Deviated Well\nWhenever a kick is taken in a highly deviated well, the circulating pressure can be\nexcessive when the kill weight mud gets to the kick-off point (KOP). If the pressure is\nexcessive, the pressure schedule should be divided into two sections: 1) from surface to KOP,\nand 2) from KOP to TD. The following calculations are used:\nDetermine strokes from surface to KOP:\nStrokes = drill pipe capacity, bbl!ft  x  measured depth to KOP, ft  x   pump output,  bbl/stk\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n90\nDetermine strokes from KOP to TD:\nStrokes = drill string capacity, bbl/ftx  measured depth to TD, ft  x  pump output, bbl/stk\nKill weight mud:                         KWM = SIDPP ÷ 0.052 ÷ TVD + OMW\nInitial circulating pressure:          ICP = SIDPP + KRP\nFinal circulating pressure:           FCP KWM x KRP ÷ 0MW\nHydrostatic pressure increase from surface to KOP:\npsi = (KWM - OMW) x 0.052 x TVD @ KOP\nFriction pressure increase to KOP:\nFP = (FCP - KRP) x MD @ KOP ÷ MD @ TD\nCirculating pressure when KWM gets to KOP:\nCP ~ KOP = ICP — HP increase to KOP + friction pressure\nincrease, psi\nNote:At this point, compare this circulating pressure to the value obtained when using a\nregular kill sheet.\nExample:    Original mud weight (OMW)           = 9.6 ppg\n                   Measured depth (MD)                     = 15,000 ft\n                   Measured depth @ KOP                  = 5000 ft\n                   True vertical depth @ KOP             = 5000 ft\n       Kill rate pressure (KRP) @ 30 spm  = 600 psi\n        Pump output                                    = 0.136 bbl/stk\n                   Drill pipe capacity                            = 0.01776 bbl/ft\n       Shut-in drill pipe pressure (SIDPP)  = 800 psi\n                   True vertical depth (TVD)               = 10,000 ft\nSolution:\nStrokes from surface to KOP:\nStrokes = 0.01776 bbl/ft x 5000 ft ÷ 0.136 bbl/stk\nStrokes = 653\nStrokes from KOP to TD:\nStrokes = 0.01776 bbl/ft x 10,000 ft + 0.136 bbl/stk\nStrokes = 1306\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n91\nTotal strokes from surface to bit:\nSurface to bit strokes = 653 + 1306\nSurface to bit strokes = 1959\nKill weight mud (KWM):\nKWM = 800 psi 0.052 + 10,000 ft + 9.6 ppg\nKWM = 11.1 ppg\nInitial circulating pressure (ICP):\nICP = 800 psi + 600 psi\nICP = 1400 psi\nFinal circulating pressure (FCP):\nFCP = 11.1 ppg x 600 psi ± 9.6 ppg\nFCP = 694 psi\nHydrostatic pressure increase from surface to KOP:\nHPi = (11.1 — 9.6) x 0.052 x 5000\nHPi = 390 psi\nFriction pressure increase to TD:\nFP = (694 — 600) x 5000 ÷ 15,000\nFP = 31 psi\nCirculating pressure when KWM gets to KOP:\nCP = 1400 — 390 + 31\nCP = 1041 psi\nCompare this circulating pressure to the value obtained when using a regular kill sheet:\npsi/stk = 1400 — 694 + 1959\npsi/stk = 0.36\n0.36psi/stk x 653 strokes = 235 psi\n1400 — 235 = 1165 psi\nUsing a regular kill sheet, the circulating drill pipe pressure would be 1165 psi. The\nadjusted pressure chart would have 1041 psi on the drill pipe gauge. This represents 124 psi\ndifference in pressure, which would also be observed on the annulus (casing) side. It is\nrecommended that if the difference in pressure at the KOP is 100 psi or greater, then the\nadjusted pressure chart should be used to minimise the chances of losing circulation.\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n92\nThe chart below graphically illustrates the difference:\nFigure 4—2. Adjusted pressure chart.\n2.                        Pre-recorded Information\nMaximum Anticipated Surface Pressure\nTwo methods are commonly used to determine maximum anticipated surface pressure:\nMethod 1:  Use when assuming the maximum formation pressure is from\n                   TD:\nStep 1  Determine maximum formation pressure (FPmax):\nFP max = (maximum mud wt to be used, ppg + safety factor, ppg) x 0.052 x (total depth, ft)\nStep 2  Assuming 100% of the mud is blown out of the hole, determine the hydrostatic\n              pressure in the wellbore:\nNote:70% to 80% of mud being blown out is sometimes used instead of l00%.\nHPgas = gas gradient, psi/ft x total depth, ft\nStep 3  Determine maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP):\nMASP = FPmax — HPgas\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n93\nExample:       Proposed total depth                                              = 12,000 ft\n                      Maximum mud weight to be used in drilling well    = 12.0 ppg\n                      Safety factor                                                          = 4.0 ppg\n                      Gas gradient                                                          =  0.12 psi/ft\nAssume that 100% of mud is blown out of well.\nStep 1   Determine fracture pressure, psi:\nFPmax = (12.0 + 4.0) x 0.052 x 12,000 ft\nFPmax = 9984 psi\nStep 2\nHPgas = 0.12 x 12,000 ft\nHPgas = 1440 psi\nStep 3\nMASP = 9984 — 1440\nMASP = 8544 psi\nMethod 2: Use when assuming the maximum pressure in the wellbore is\n                  attained when the formation at the shoe fractures:\nStep 1\nFracture, psi  =  (estimated fracture + safety factor, ppg) x 0.052 x (casing shoe TVD, ft)\npressure             (gradient, ppg                                       )\nNote:A safety factor is added to ensure the formation fractures before BOP pressure rating\nis exceeded.\nStep 2   Determine the hydrostatic pressure of gas in the wellbore (HPgas):\nHPgas = gas gradient, psi/ft x casing shoe TVD, ft\nStep 3   Determine the maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP), psi:\nExample:    Proposed casing setting depth    = 4000 ft\n                  Estimated fracture gradient         = 14.2 ppg\n                  Safety factor                               = 1.0 ppg\n                  Gas gradient                               =  0.12 psi/ft\nAssume 100°/ of mud is blown out of the hole.\nStep 1    Fracture pressure, psi  = (14.2 + 1.0) x 0.052 x 4000 ft\n                 Fracture pressure, psi  = 3162 psi\nStep 2    HPgas = 0.12 x 4000 ft\n                 HPgas = 480 psi\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n94\nStep 3    MASP = 3162 — 480\n                 MASP = 2682 psi\nSizing Diverter Lines\nDetermine diverter line inside diameter, in., equal to the area between the inside diameter of\nthe casing and the outside diameter of drill pipe in use:\nDiverter line ID, in. = ~Ib~bp2\nExample:   Casing— 13-3/8 in. — J-55 — 61 IbIft ID = 12.515 in.\n                  Drill pipe — 19.5 lb/ft OD                          = 5.0 in.\nDetermine the diverter line inside diameter that will equal the area between the casing and drill\npipe:\nDiverter line ID, in. = sq. root (12.515\n2\n — 5.0\n2\n)\nDiverter line ID = 11.47 in.\nFormation Pressure Tests\nTwo methods of testing:          •Equivalent mud weight test\n •Leak-off test\nPrecautions to be undertaken before testing:\n1.        Circulate and condition the mud to ensure the mud weight is consistent throughout the\n           system.\n2.        Change the pressure gauge (if possible) to a smaller increment gauge so a more\n           accurate measure can be determined.\n3.        Shut-in the well.\n4.        Begin pumping at a very slow rate — 1/4 to 1/2 bbl/min.\n5.        Monitor pressure, time, and barrels pumped.\n6.        Some operators may have different procedures in running this test, others may\n           include:\na.

No communication exists between tubing and annulus.\nb) Tubing in the well, influx in the annulus, and for some reason, cannot circulate through the\n     tubing.\nc)  No tubing in the well.

Tubing pressure profile.\nLubricate and Bleed\nThe lubricate and bleed method involves alternately pumping a kill fluid into the tubing\nor  into  the  casing  if  there  is  no  tubing  in  the  well,  allowing  the  kill  fluid  to  fall,  then  bleeding\noff  a  volume  of  gas  until  kill  fluid  reaches  the  choke.  As  each  volume  of  kill  fluid  is  pumped\ninto  the  tubing,  the  SITP  should  decrease  by  a  calculated  value  until  the  well  is  eventually\nkilled.\nThis  method  is  often  used  for  two  reasons:  1)  shut-in  pressures  approach  the  rated\nworking  pressure  of  the  wellhead  or  tubing  and  dynamic  pumping  pressure  may  exceed  the\nlimits, as in the case of bullheading, and 2) either to completely kill the well or lower the SITP\nto a value where other kill methods can be safely employed without exceeding rated limits.\nThis  method  can  also  be  applied  when  the  wellbore  or  perforations  are  lugged,\nrendering bullheading useless. In this case, the well can be killed without necessitating the use\nof tubing or snubbing small diameter tubing.\nUsers  should  be  aware  that  the  lubricate  and  bleed  method  is  often  a  very  time\nconsuming process, whereas another method may kill the well more quickly. The following is\nan example of a typical lubricate and bleed kill procedure.\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n122\nExample:   A workover is planned for a well where the SITP approaches the working pressure\n                  of the wellhead equipment. To minimise the possibility of equipment failure, the\n                  lubricate and bleed method will be used to reduce the SITP to a level at which\n                  bullheading can be safely conducted. The data below will be used to describe this\n                  procedure:\nTVD                         = 6500 ft         Depth of perforations          = 6450 ft\nSITP                         = 2830 psi       Tubing   6.5 lb/ft-N-80        = 2-7/8 in.\nKill fluid density       = 9.0 ppg          Wellhead working pressure = 3000 psi\nTubing internal yield = 10,570 psi     Tubing capacity        = 0.00579 bbl/ft (172.76 ft/bbl)\nCalculations:     Calculate the expected pressure reduction for each barrel of kill fluid pumped:\npsi/bbl = tubing capacity, ft/bbl x 0.052 x kill weight fluid, ppg\npsi/bbl = 172.76 ft/bbl x 0.052 x 9.0 ppg\npsi/bbl = 80.85\nFor each one barrel pumped, the SITP will be reduced by 80.85 psi.\nCalculate tubing capacity, bbl, to the perforations:\nbbl = tubing capacity, bbl/ft x depth to perforations, ft\nbbl = 0.00579 bbl/ft x 6450 ft\nbbl = 37.3 bbl\nProcedure:\n1. Rig up all surface equipment including pumps and gas flare lines.\n2. Record SITP and SICP.\n3. Open the choke to allow gas to escape from the well and momentarily reduce the SITP.\n4. Close the choke and pump in 9.0 ppg brine until the tubing pressure reaches 2830 psi.\n5. Wait for a period of time to allow the brine to fall in the tubing. This period will range\n    from 1/4 to 1 hour depending on gas density, pressure, and tubing size.\n6. Open the choke and bleed gas until 9.0 brine begins to escape.\n7. Close the choke and pump in 9.0 ppg brine water.\n8. Continue the process until a low level, safe working pressure is attained.\nA  certain  amount  of  time  is  required  for  the  kill  fluid  to  fall  down  the  tubing  after  the\npumping  stops.  The  actual  waiting  time  is  not  to  allow  fluid  to  fall,  but  rather,  for  gas  to\nmigrate  up  through  the  kill  fluid.  Gas  migrates  at  rates  of  1000  to  2000  ft/hr.  Therefore\nconsiderable time is required for fluid to fall or migrate to 6500 ft. Therefore, after pumping, it\nis  important  to  wait  several  minutes  before  bleeding  gas  to  prevent  bleeding  off  kill  fluid\nthrough the choke.\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n123\nReferences\nAdams, Neal, Well Control Problems and Solutions, PennWell Publishing Company, Tulsa,\n   OK, 1980.\nAdams, Neal, Workover Well Control, PennWell Publishing Company, Tulsa, OK, 1984.\nGoldsmith, Riley, Why Gas Cut Mud Is Not Always a Serious Problem, World Oil, Oct. 1972.\nGrayson, Richard and Fred S.

The amount of deviation is a function of\nthe drift angle (inclination) and hole depth.\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n150\nThe following diagram illustrates how to determine the deviation/departure:\nDATA:\nAB =  distance from the surface location to the KOP\nBC =  distance from KOP to the true vertical depth\n          (TVD)\nBD = distance from KOP to the bottom of the hole\n          (MD)\nCD = Deviation/departure—departure of the\n          wellbore from the vertical\nAC = true vertical depth\nAD = Measured depth\nFigure 5-4.  Deviation/Departure\nTo calculate the deviation/departure (CD), ft:       CD, ft = sin I x BD\nExample: Kick off point (KOP) is a distance 2000 ft from the surface.\n                MD is 8000 ft. Hole angle (inclination) is 20 degrees.\n                Therefore the distance from KOP to MD = 6000 ft (BD):\nCD, ft = sin 20 x 6000 ft\nCD, ft = 0.342 x 6000 ft\nCD     = 2052 ft\nFrom this calculation, the measured depth (MD) is 2052 ft away from vertical.\nDogleg Severity Calculation\nMethod 1\nDogleg severity (DLS) is usually given in degrees/100 ft. The following formula\nprovides dogleg severity in degrees/100 ft and is based on the Radius of Curvature Method:\nDLS = {cos.\n—1\n [(cos. I1 x cos. I2) + (sin. I1 x sin. 12) x cos. (A2 — Al)]} x (100 ÷ CL)\nFor metric calculation, substitute  x (30 ÷ CL) i.e.\nDLS = {cos.\n—1\n [(cos. I1 x cos. I2) + (sin. I1 x sin. 12) x cos. (A2 — Al)]} x (30 ÷ CL)\nwhere       DLS          = dogleg severity, degrees/l00 ft\n                 CL            = course length, distance between survey points, ft\n                 I1, I2        = inclination (angle) at upper and lower surveys, ft\n                 Al, A2      = direction at upper and lower surveys, degrees\n                 ^Azimuth = azimuth change between surveys, degrees\n\nFormulas and Calculations\n151\nExample:                            Survey 1                         Survey 2\nDepth, ft42314262\nInclination, degrees13.514.7\nAzimuth, degreesN 10 EN 19 E\nDLS = {cos.\n—1 \n[(cos. 13.5 x cos. l4.7) + (sin. 13.5 x sin. 14.7 x cos.

This\ncalculation will give the approximate TVD interval corresponding to the measured interval and\nis generally accurate enough for any pressure calculations. At the next survey, the TVD should\nbe corrected to correspond to the directional Driller’s calculated true vertical depth:\nTVD\n2 \n= cos I x CL + TVD\n1\nwhere   TVD\n2 \n= new true vertical depth, ft\n            TVD\n1\n = last true vertical depth, ft\n            CL     = course length — number of feet since last survey\n            cos    = cosine\nExample:    TVD (last survey) = 8500 ft           Deviation angle  = 40 degrees\n       Course length        = 30 ft\nSolution:     TVD\n2 \n= cos 40 x 30 ft + 8500 ft\n                   TVD\n2 \n= 0.766 x 30 ft + 8500 ft\n                   TVD\n2 \n= 22.98 ft + 8500 ft\n                   TVD\n2 \n= 8522.98 ft\n11.
